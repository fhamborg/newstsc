{"global_context": "The anti-John Cox mailers are \"Paid for by Families & Teachers for Antonio Villaraigosa for Governor 2018,\" but designed to look like they are from Republicans. Republican voters in California are receiving mailers attacking Republican businessman John Cox ahead of the June 5 primary election. That, by itself, is no surprise: Cox is in second place in many polls, behind frontrunner Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, and only the top two finishers in the “jungle” primary will advance to the general election. Nor is it surprising that the attacks are coming from supporters of Democrat former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who was long expected to breeze through the primary until Cox surged in recent months. What is surprising is that the mailers are attacking Cox from the right, echoing attacks that have been launched by Cox’s main Republican rival, Assemblyman Travis Allen (R-Huntington Beach). The mailers refer to Cox as a “Democratic Activist” and a “Chicago Liberal,” and note that he did not vote for Donald Trump in 2016. (Trump has since endorsed Cox for governor). One mailer is actually designed to look like it comes from Travis Allen. There is an attractive photograph of Allen and his family next to a military aircraft, plus a list of Republican endorsements for Allen. It is only once readers see the fine print of who paid for the ads that the truth becomes clear: the mailers are “Paid for by Families & Teachers for Antonio Villaraigosa for Governor 2018, sponsored by California Charter Schools Association Advocates,” groups that are backing the Democrat. What looks like Republican mailers are actually propaganda placed by Democrats in an attempt to split the Republican vote and create an opening for Villaraigosa to qualify for the general election. Many of the claims by the group against Cox were debunked by the Sacramento Bee: “John Cox did lose 13 campaigns before running for governor, but he isn’t a secret Democrat.” These sorts of tricks are commonplace — and legal — in California, where all is fair in the “jungle” primary.

{"global_context": "President Donald Trump is due to sign an executive order Thursday morning intended to allow individuals and small businesses to buy a long-disputed type of health insurance that skirts state regulations and Affordable Care Act protections. The White House and allies portray the president's move to expand access to \"association health plans\" as wielding administrative powers to accomplish what congressional Republicans have failed to achieve: tearing down the law's insurance marketplaces and letting some Americans buy skimpier coverage at lower prices. The order will be Trump's biggest step to carry out a broad but ill-defined directive his first night in office for agencies to lessen ACA regulations from the Obama administration. Critics, who include state insurance commissioners, most of the health-insurance industry and mainstream policy specialists, predict that a proliferation of such health plans will have damaging ripple effects: driving up costs for consumers with serious medical conditions and prompting more insurers to flee the law's marketplaces. Part of Trump's actions, they predict, will spark court challenges over their legality. According to numerous people familiar with the White House's anticipated order, the most far-reaching element will be instructing a trio of Cabinet departments to rewrite federal rules for association health plans - a type of insurance in which small businesses of a similar type band together through an association to negotiate health benefits. The order also is expected to expand the availability of short-term insurance policies, which offer limited benefits meant as a bridge for people between jobs or young adults no longer eligible for their parents' health plans. The Obama administration ruled that short-term insurance may not last for more than three months; Trump is planning to extend that to nearly a year. In addition, Trump's action is intended to widen employers' ability to use pretax dollars to help workers pay for any medical expenses, not just for health policies that meet ACA rules - another reversal of Obama policy. The executive order will fulfill a quest by conservative Republicans, especially in the House, who have unsuccessfully sought for more than two decades to expand the availability of association health plans, allowing them to be sold, unregulated, across state lines. As details of what the president is likely to sign spread in Washington in recent days, health policy experts in think tanks, academia and the health-care industry emphasized that the order's final language - and the ensuing fine print from agencies' rules - will determine whether the impact will be as sweeping or quick as Trump has boasted. \"It's going to cover a lot of territory and a lot of people, millions of people,\" the president said two weeks ago. On Tuesday, he added: \"It will be great, great health care for many, many people.\" In an interview Wednesday night with Sean Hannity of Fox News, he again predicted a big impact. \"People say 30 percent, some people say 25 percent and some people say it could be 50 percent,\" Trump told Hannity. \"It's going to cover a large percentage of the people that we're talking about.\" The action will come three weeks before the Nov. 1 start of the fifth open-enrollment season in ACA marketplaces for people who do not have access to affordable health benefits through a job. It is uncertain whether the departments - Health and Human Services, Treasury and Labor - will finalize rules carrying out the order in time for new insurance to be sold for 2018. Even so, with a shortened sign-up period and large cuts in federal funds for advertising and enrollment help already hobbling the marketplaces, \"if there's a lot of hoopla around new options that may be available soon, it could be one more thing that discourages enrollment,\" said Larry Levitt, Kaiser Family Foundation's senior vice president. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) is among the groups that have long opposed any expansion of coverage that bypasses state regulation. In congressional testimony in February, the NAIC said allowing health plans to be sold without requiring either state licenses or federal approval \"would result in less protections for the most vulnerable populations and the collapse of individual markets.\" Under the president's anticipated order, association health plans will be able to avoid many ACA rules, including the law's benefits requirements, limits on consumers' yearly and lifetime costs, and ban on charging more to customers who have been sick. Critics say that young and healthy people who use relatively little insurance would gravitate to those plans because of their lower price tags, while older and sicker customers would be concentrated in ACA marketplaces with spiking rates. \"It would be different pools under different rules,\" said one senior health policy source who spoke on the condition of anonymity since the order is not yet public. Currently, short-term health insurance makes up a tiny fraction of the policies sold, with fewer than 30 companies covering only about 160,000 people nationwide at the end of last year, according to NAIC data. Experts could not point to figures for how many association health plans exist or how many people they insure. Such arrangements have existed for decades, and scandals have on occasion exposed \"multi-employer welfare arrangements\" started by unscrupulous operators who took members' money and either did not have enough reserves to cover hospital bills or absconded with premiums. The National Federation of Independent Business, the small-business lobby, has pressed Congress to allow use of association plans, arguing that they can be less expensive and give workers more insurance choices. This year, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, pushed an amendment to unsuccessful ACA-repeal legislation that would have had a parallel effect, letting any insurer selling at least one policy that met the law's coverage rules also sell skimpier and cheaper plans. Selling health plans from state to state without separate licenses - the idea underlying much of the president's anticipated order - has long been a Republican mantra. It has gained little traction in practice, however.

Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf responded to Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s rebuke on Wednesday, telling reporters that Sessions and President Donald Trump were “racist” for conflating criminals with “immigrants.” In a speech earlier to a gathering of the California Peace Officers Association, Sessions had outlined the U.S. Department of Justice’s case against the state’s “sanctuary” laws, which it filed late Tuesday. He also delivered a rebuke to Schaaf for warning illegal aliens ahead of a raid by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in February — a warning that ICE said caused 800 illegal aliens, including convicts, to escape: ” “How dare you. How dare you needlessly endanger the lives of law enforcement just to promote your radical open borders agenda.” In response, Schaaf delivered a statement at a press conference in Oakland (via CBS San Francisco): My response to the Attorney General’s statements this morning is as follows: How dare you vilify members of our community by trying to frighten the American public into thinking that all undocumented immigrants are dangerous criminals — hard-working, law-abiding Oakland’s like Eusebio and Maria Sanchez, whom you ripped away from their American-born children and the cancer patients at our public hospital who relied on Maria’s nursing skills every day? How dare you distract the American people from a failed immigration system that tears apart families and forces the workers that out economy depends on to harvest our crops, delver our services, and build our cities to live in fear and work under oppressed conditions? How dare you distort the reality about declining violent crime in a diverse sanctuary city like Oakland, California, to advance your racist agenda? I am confident that the courts will resolve the dispute between the administration and the great State of California. I am ready to get back to work doing my job as the mayor of Oakland — addressing homelessness, building affordable housing, fixing the streets, creating safe neighborhoods, and ensuring that the children of my community, no matter where they came from, or how they got here, have every opportune for success. Oakland’s agenda is a thriving community. Trump’s agenda is bigotry and vindictiveness. Sessions told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview early Tuesday morning that the Department of Justice was investigating Schaaf for her actions in warning illegal aliens of the ICE raids, but said he could not comment on the case until he had received recommendations from the department’s lawyers. Schaaf argued that most of the people targeted in the February raid had not been convicted of crimes other than illegal immigration. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

{"global_context": "The president goes on a tweetstorm in response to New York Times report of a Russia-related FBI investigation of Trump last year. CLOSE President Donald Trump is claiming that no American president has been as \"tough\" on Russia as he has been, amid ongoing criticism of his Helsinki summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. (July 18) AP President Donald Trump, in response to reports that the FBI began an investigation of him last year to find out whether he had a clandestine agenda to help Russia, said Saturday that former FBI director James Comey and other \"losers\" at the bureau \"tried to do a number on your President.\" He called Comey a \"total sleaze\" and \"crooked cop\" and took swipes at special counsel Robert Mueller and the New York Times, which broke the story Friday night. \"My firing of James Comey was a great day for America,\" he tweeted. The newspaper said the decision to investigate Trump himself was an aggressive move by FBI officials confronting the chaotic aftermath of the firing of Comey and enduring the president’s verbal assaults on the Russia investigation as a “witch hunt.” CNN reported that counterintelligence agents were investigating why Trump was acting in ways that seemed to benefit Russia. Both news organizations said Trump's firing of Comey was a major factor prompting the FBI to take action. Donald Trump (Photo: JIM WATSON, AFP/Getty Images) Although the report was published Friday night and prompted a sharp response from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, Trump did not weigh in until 7:05 a.m Saturday. \"Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin’ James Comey, a total sleaze! In a series of tweets, he said the FBI was in \"complete turmoil\" at the time because of Comey's \"poor leadership\" and his handling of an investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. \"My firing of James Comey was a great day for America,\" Trump tweeted. \"He was a Crooked Cop...........who is being totally protected by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats...\" He singled out several FBI agents in his five-part tweetstorm. \"Lyin’ James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter S and his lover, agent Lisa Page, & more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President,\" he tweeted. \"Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the 'insurance policy?' This is it!\" Trump was referring to charges that some FBI agents, among them McCabe, Peter Strzok and Page, a colleague he was intimately involved with, were part of a conspiracy to undermine the president. Addressing the Russia aspect of the Times report, Trump said he had been \"FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President.\" Lyin’ James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter S and his lover, agent Lisa Page, & more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President. Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the “insurance policy?” This is it! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 12, 2019 He repeated his long held contention that \"getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing.\" Sanders said in her statement Friday night that Comey was fired for just cause and that Trump has never favored Russia. “This is absurd. James Comey was fired because he’s a disgraced partisan hack, and his Deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI. Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia.” The obstruction probe was an idea the FBI had previously considered, but it didn't start until Comey was fired, CNN reported. The justification went beyond Trump's firing of Comey, CNN said, according to its sources, and included the president's conversation with Comey in the Oval Office asking him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Trump insisted last year that he didn't fire FBI Director James Comey because of the Russia investigation, despite video and documentary evidence to the contrary, including a key interview with NBC's Lester Holt. \"Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia!\" Trump tweeted shortly after the firing. \"The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!\" The FBI director's firing is central to an obstruction of justice investigation being conducted by Mueller, who is also looking into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election in order to help Trump.

Meanwhile on Wednesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a confirmation hearing for Jeffrey A. Rosen, whom Mr. Trump has nominated to be Mr. Barr’s deputy. Mr. Rosen, who is currently the deputy secretary of transportation, would succeed Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who appointed Mr. Mueller. Mr. Rosen largely sidestepped questions about the Russia investigation and Mueller report, saying he was not part of the department yet and did not know the facts. But Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, noted that some criminal matters that developed from Mr. Mueller’s work are continuing even though the Office of the Special Counsel is shutting down, and she pressed Mr. Rosen to commit to letting them proceed without political interference. “If I am confirmed,” Mr. Rosen replied, “I would expect in all prosecutorial matters to proceed on the facts and the law and not any improper political influences.” Ms. Klobuchar did not name which matters she had in mind, though several cases are still working their way through the court system, including the indictment of Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime informal adviser to Mr. Trump. Separately, under questioning by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, Mr. Rosen defended his role in creating a Trump administration proposal on tailpipe pollution rules. Ms. Feinstein referred to a New York Times article that portrayed him as pushing to let cars emit more greenhouse gases. Mr. Rosen said the article had several errors, although he did not identify them. He also said the issue was how to carry out a law that required annual increases in fuel economy standards through 2020, and then set criteria for decisions about whether to require any further escalations in the years after that. The Trump administration, he said, was merely proposing a “timeout” after 2020. In fact, the current regulations, put forth by the Obama administration, require automakers to keep improving the fuel economy of passenger vehicles through 2025. The administration’s preferred proposal would therefore allow more greenhouse gas pollution than current rules.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis met with their Chinese counterparts Friday at the State Department, with both sides expressing hopes for a cooperative relationship, but also airing significant differences. In many ways, it embodied the Trump administration’s new maxim with China: Competition does not mean hostility. In a nearly 40 minute press conference after a meeting that ran a bit longer than expected, both sides discussed where they saw areas of agreement and disagreement. While there were some notes of harmony, there was a lot more discord. The U.S. side began with Pompeo listing areas of potential cooperation. He said North Korea was an area of cooperation where China could help achieve “meaningful breakthroughs.” He also said he hoped to see cooperation from China in addressing Iran’s nuclear missile programs and other malign activities. “Bringing Iran’s oil export revenues to zero is a critical component of this campaign, and we discussed this today,” he said. But the “significant differences” included China’s emplacement of military weapons on islands and other land features in the South China Sea that are also claimed by multiple other East Asian nations, China’s attempts to strip away Taiwan’s diplomatic allies, and its repression of religious minorities. Despite those differences, Pompeo said the U.S. is “not pursuing a cold war or containment policy with China. “Rather, we want to ensure that China acts responsibly and fairly in support of security and prosperity of each of our two countries,” he said.

Pompeo: “The United States is not pursuing a cold war or a containment policy with China.” pic.twitter.com/wy1zjjW8kM — Kristina Wong (@kristina_wong) November 9, 2018 China’s foreign minister began that country’s portion of the press conference with areas of disagreement with the U.S. Director of the Office of Foreign Affairs of the Central Commission of the Communist Party of China Yang Jiechi called the discussions “candid, constructive, and productive.” But he said China is “firm” on proceeding as a socialist nation with Chinese “characteristics,” and that it is not intended to “challenge or displace anyone.” He also said China was “firmly resolved to safeguard its sovereignty and [territorial] integrity,” going straight to what China considers its most “sensitive” issue with the U.S. — Taiwan. “Taiwan independent forces and their separatist activities” posed the biggest threat to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. “The U.S. should recognize it, clearly,” he said, urging the U.S. to “cautiously handle Taiwan-related matters.” On the South China Sea, Yang defended building military facilities on some islands as necessary in response to “possible threats from outside,” without elaborating on those threats. He also suggested that the U.S. was militarizing the region by conducting freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea. “We believe that no country should use any excuse to engage in militarization in the region,” Yang said. “Actually, to pursue militarization in the region will not only undermine interests of regional countries, but will hurt the countries who take these actions themselves.” In a not-so-veiled barb to U.S. leaders who say the U.S. is “a Pacific nation,” Yang said, “We respect the United States’ interest in the Asia-Pacific. At the same time, we expect the United States to respect China’s security interests in the Asia-Pacific, China’s sovereignty and development interests.” On the Iran nuclear deal, Yang said it needed to be “implemented and observed,” and reaffirmed China’s commitment to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and said China would continue to “enforce strictly” relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. He said both sides exchanged views on Afghanistan and other regional and international issues, and agreed to “step up communication and coordination and play a positive role in seeking proper settlement to relevant issues.” Mattis reiterated the U.S. stance that all parties adhere to international law when it comes to territorial disputes in the South China Sea, but noted that the U.S.-China military relationship could serve as a source of stability between the nations. His counterpart, Minister of National Defense of the People’s Republic of China General Wei Fenghe echoed those remarks. The Chinese tone became more pointed, however, during the question and answer session with journalists, who honed in on areas of disagreement. Yang, the Chinese foreign minister, said he “made it clear” to the U.S. that it should stop sending ships and aircraft close to “Chinese islands” in the South China Sea. He also said Taiwan is an “inalienable part of the Chinese territory.” In regards to Chinese treatment of religious minorities, he said, “Foreign countries have no right to interfere.” He said he hoped the U.S. would “stop interfering in China’s internal affairs.” Wei, the defense minister said Taiwan is an “inseparable” part of China, and if China’s territorial integrity is under threat, it would reunify Taiwan “at any cost, just like what the U.S. side had in Civil War.” Mattis remained mostly straight-faced and expressionless throughout the conference. Pompeo wielded a tight-lipped smile while listening to his counterpart at times. Friday’s meeting was the second time the leaders of the State and Defense Departments met with their Chinese counterparts for the U.S.-China Diplomatic and Security Dialogue, put into place by President Trump last year. Yang said he hoped the issues in U.S.-China economic and trade relations could be resolved through dialogue and consultation, and that a trade war would only “end up hurting both sides and the global economy.” “I, for one, believe that our friendship has sunken deep within the hearts of our two peoples, and will grow into a big tree with big foliage. The further development of China-U.S. relations will, for sure, give our two peoples a greater sense of gain and satisfaction,” he said. Meanwhile, across town at a think-tank, the tone from Trump’s top trade adviser was notably less friendly Peter Navarro, speaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, blasted China for its aggressive trade practices with the U.S. that hurt American businesses and workers. He said during a round of negotiations earlier this year, he and other advisers went to Beijing to negotiate with the Chinese. He said they put down a long list of demands. The Chinese refused to acknowledge U.S. concerns. “What do we hear? ‘We don’t engage in cyber theft, we are the biggest victim of cyber theft, we don’t force technology transfers.’ How do you have a deal with somebody if they won’t even acknowledge your concerns? It is Alice in Wonderland,” he said. He also accused China of trying to continue talking to the U.S. and delay any reforms. “That’s all they want to do. They want to get us to the bargaining table, sound reasonable, and talk their way while they keep having their way with us.” He also poured cold water on reaching a trade deal when Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping meet in Buenos Aires, Argentina, later this month for the G-20 meeting. He blasted a “self-appointed group of Wall Street bankers and hedge fund managers” shuttling back and forth between Beijing in hopes of pressuring the White House to end the trade war with China. “When these unpaid foreign agents engage in this kind of diplomacy — so-called diplomacy — all they do is weaken this president and his negotiating position. No good can come of this,” he said. “If and when there is a deal, it will be on President Donald Trump’s terms, not Wall Street’s terms,” he said.

A security alert sent to United Nations staff in Kabul said the blast occurred near the compound of a private security company between a residential area for foreign aid workers and the military side of the national airport. The notice said the explosion was followed by exchanges of gunfire that were continuing. The airport was closed for all takeoffs and landings. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the explosion, and no casualty figures were available. An Afghan official told local media that the suicide vehicle detonated outside the front gate of international private security compound, after which several gunmen attacked compound on foot. The area has been cordoned off by Afghan security forces. The Reuters news agency, citing a senior security official, reported that the blast site was close to the compound of British security contractor group G4S, near an industrial park on the main road leading out of Kabul toward eastern Afghanistan.

{"global_context": "President Donald Trump's naming of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general has already reached the Supreme Court. The dispute over President Trump's naming of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general reached the Supreme Court Friday. (Photo: J. Scott Applewhite, AP) WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump's naming of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general has already reached the Supreme Court. Veteran Supreme Court litigator Thomas Goldstein filed a motion on an unrelated case late Friday that asks the justices to decide if Whitaker was legally installed as the successor to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was ousted last week. His goal is the same as that of Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh: getting a federal court to rule that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is the legal heir to Sessions. That would protect the investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and potential coordination with the Trump campaign. Frosh filed his challenge in federal district court in Maryland earlier this week, calling Whitaker's appointment \"illegal and unconstitutional.\" Goldstein's effort is aimed at leapfrogging lower courts and getting the Supreme Court to decide. The issue is important nationwide because all lawsuits against the Justice Department that name Sessions as the respondent must be automatically changed to name his successor. Currently, courts are automatically substituting Whitaker's name. Whitaker’s appointment has drawn a wave of criticism from Democrats and some Republicans who contend he lacks authority to serve as the nation’s chief law enforcement officer because he has not been confirmed by the Senate. In addition, Whitaker’s past public criticism of the Russia investigation has prompted Democrats to call for his recusal from overseeing the Mueller inquiry. A 20-page Justice Department opinion issued earlier this week concluded that Whitaker’s standing as a senior department executive “unquestionably” authorized Trump to elevate the former Iowa federal prosecutor, even though he lacks Senate confirmation required of other Cabinet officials. Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel based its findings on provisions of the Vacancies Reform Act, which allows for the appointment of a senior staffer who has been in office for at least 90 days. Prior to his appointment, Whitaker served as Sessions' chief of staff. An existing line of succession within the department, known as the Attorney General Successions Act, provides for the deputy attorney general or another Senate-confirmed official to serve as acting attorney general in the event of a vacancy. But the Justice Department argued that the Vacancies Reform Act can supersede that provision. The opinion went on to assert that Whitaker’s designation was in keeping with the Constitution, which requires the president to obtain Senate approval before appointing so-called “principal” officers.

Jeremy Hunt has called on Boris Johnson not to be a “coward” by avoiding a live TV debate with him this week as the Tory leadership race turned personal. Hunt suggested dodging a Sky News head-to-head would risk his rival “slinking through the back door” of Number 10 as Johnson remained under pressure to explain why police were called to the home he shares with partner Carrie Symonds, Foreign Secretary Hunt has previously attacked Johnson over reports he was “bottling” a live TV debate before postal ballots are returned. In his column for the Daily Telegraph, Johnson attempted to switch attention back to political rather than personal issues as he repeated his determination to deliver Brexit by Halloween. Stepping up pressure on his rival, Hunt insisted that while he has no interest in debating Johnson’s private life, he wants to challenge him on television over his commitment to taking the UK out of the EU by the end of October. In an article in The Times, Hunt said: “A new prime minister needs the legitimacy of having made his arguments publicly and having them subjected to scrutiny. “Only then can you walk through the front door of No 10 with your head held high instead of slinking through the back door, which is what Boris appears to want.” He added: “Don’t be a coward Boris, man up and show the nation you can cope with the intense scrutiny the most difficult job in the country will involve.” Hunt said on Sunday that he thought any candidate for prime minister “should answer questions on everything”. Meanwhile, Johnson wrote in the Telegraph: “We must leave the EU on Oct 31 come what may. It will honour the referendum result, it will focus the minds of EU negotiators.” He added: “It is absolutely vital that we keep our eyes on the prize. It has been a long and parching march – but the oasis is finally in sight. “We are just over four months away from the date on which, by law, we must leave the EU; and this time we are not going to bottle it. We are not going to fail. “This time we are not going to shrink in fear from the exit, as we have on the last two occasions.” This is what I was writing about this morning. It's rubbish. Vacuous rubbish. You can't just bang on about \"mettle\" and \"creativity\". You have to set out a plan. An actual plan. https://t.co/LrdUKsUAIh — (((Dan Hodges))) (@DPJHodges) June 23, 2019 Earlier, Hunt took a swipe at his competitor for Downing Street after Johnson repeatedly refused to reveal what led to the police involvement in the early hours of Friday morning. Hunt told Sky News: “I think someone who wants to be prime minister should answer questions on everything. “But I’m not going to comment on issues of character because … I am sure you and I have got things, that, you know, we would be embarrassed if they came out. “I just think it’s irrelevant given the gravity of the situation. I am not going to comment on Boris’s personal life. That’s for others to make their judgments on.” The Foreign Secretary insisted his predecessor in the Cabinet role was trying to avoid scrutiny in the battle for Number 10. “What Boris needs to do is engage properly in this leadership debate. “This is an audition to be the prime minister of the United Kingdom and Boris needs to show that he is prepared to answer difficult questions.” Hunt supporter and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox signalled it was better to be clear about what had happened. Dr Fox told BBC1’s The Andrew Marr Show: “I think it is always easier to just give an explanation.” He added: “It is inevitable there is a focus on private lives. That does not concern me. What I am concerned about are the issues.” Johnson repeatedly refused to explain to Tory grassroots at a Saturday hustings what went on at the south London flat in the early hours of Friday morning, saying the party faithful did not want “to hear about that kind of thing”. Johnson’s campaign for Number 10 was rocked by the revelations that officers were called to the home he shares with partner Symonds by a neighbour who claimed to have been “frightened and concerned” after hearing shouting, “a loud scream” and banging coming from the property. A poll carried out after the reports emerged suggested Johnson’s support among Tory voters had dropped by more than half while among the general electorate it indicated he had slipped into second place behind rival Hunt. PA Wire/PA Images At the hustings, moderator Iain Dale drew heckles from some in the crowd when he asked Johnson whether a person’s private life had any bearing on someone’s ability to discharge the office of prime minister. “Don’t boo the great man,” Johnson said, but Dale suggested he was “completely avoiding” the question. On Saturday night, the neighbour who rang the Metropolitan Police went public after suggestions that his recording of the row had been leaked to The Guardian with political intent. Tom Penn said the allegations were “bizarre and fictitious”, explaining in a statement to the paper that he dialled 999 after hearing shouting coming from his neighbour’s flat. “It was loud enough and angry enough that I felt frightened and concerned for the welfare of those involved, so I went inside my own home, closed the door, and pressed record on the voice memos app on my phone,” the 29-year-old playwright said. “After a loud scream and banging, followed by silence, I ran upstairs, and with my wife agreed that we should check on our neighbours. “I knocked three times at their front door, but there was no response. I went back upstairs into my flat and we agreed that we should call the police.”.

{"global_context": "Glenview trustee candidate Benjamin Polony, 19, said Wednesday he is confident his nominating petitions will withstand the scrutiny after an objection was filed against them. A village Electoral Board hearing was convened Wednesday at Glenview Village Hall to hear the challenge. “This is some attempt by an opposing party to try to scare me off the ballot,” Polony said after opening arguments in the village Electoral Board’s review. “They probably see me as an easy target because I'm 19. They got that wrong. I'm ready to fight this and win and win the election.” The Electoral Board, comprised of Village President James Patterson, Village Clerk Matthew Formica and Trustee Deborah Karton, moved to continue the hearing until the Cook County Clerk’s Office can schedule a time to inspect Polony’s petitions. Polony is seeking one of three trustee seats open in the April 2 election. He is running against two slates of three candidates each. Mary Cooper, Chuck Gitles and incumbent Michael Jenny were endorsed by the Citizens for Glenview. Tom Greenhaw, Dia Morgan and Cathy Wilson are running as part of the Better Government in Glenview Party. Glenview residents Elizabeth Brown, Kathleen Gazda, Judith Traynor and William Traynor, none of whom are seeking village office in the April municipal election, have filed multiple objections to Polony’s petitions, said Mary Ryan Norwell, an attorney representing the four in the case. Polony’s petitions contain signatures of people who are not registered to vote at the addresses on the petitions, fraudulent signatures, signatures of people who live outside Glenview, missing or incomplete addresses, and people who signed more than once, Norwell said. “Because of these irregularities and insufficiencies, we believe the nominating papers contain fewer than the minimum number of signatures as required by election code,” she said. “We’re asking that the candidate’s name be stricken and not appear on the ballot in the April election.” Polony’s father, Richard Polony, who is representing him in the case, said many of the signatures were collected at Glenview Village Hall from Glenview residents who had just voted in the November election. “We were surprised to see objections to individuals who had just voted in the election,” Richard Polony said. “To say those signatures were not registered voters or were forgeries was a surprise. Some of those individuals were our own neighbors. We know them personally and yet their signatures were objected to.” Polony said once the petitions are reviewed, the board will find that the objections are “not well founded.” Attorneys for both sides agreed to follow the board’s proposed rules for the hearing after some discussion of the delay in notifying Benjamin Polony of Wednesday’s hearing. He agreed to waive any objection to the fact that he had not yet received formal notification of the hearing even as it began Wednesday. Benjamin Polony said he learned of the hearing time and date from a newspaper reporter. Board attorney Eric Patt said the board carefully followed Illinois law in notifying both parties of the case via certified mail sent Saturday, Dec. 29, but slow mail service during the New Year’s Day holiday weekend likely caused the delay in notification.

{"global_context": "Mr. Kelly, the new chief of staff and a retired Marine general, is seeking to calm the chaotic churn around the president but not to directly control his behavior. Mr. Kelly’s predecessor, Reince Priebus, sent some similar guidelines around early in the administration, according to two officials, but they were never taken seriously. Mr. Kelly, a retired Marine general, has been treated with a different level of deference inside the building, those aides said. Staff members discovered early on that they could defy Mr. Priebus, the officials said, but crossing a Marine is a different matter. Mr. Kelly has made clear that one thing he will not seek to directly control is the behavior of the president, and there is a good reason for that. Mr. Trump has a history of lashing out at advisers who have publicly conveyed their attempts to impose tighter procedures on him. Just before Election Day, for example, Mr. Trump blew up publicly after a New York Times report that his aides had succeeded in keeping him off Twitter for the final stages of the campaign. He tweeted several times to enforce the point. Despite Mr. Kelly’s fairly deft touch at approaching the president, Mr. Trump has shown signs of rebelling after stories have appeared describing how his chief of staff has put tighter controls in place and is imposing some discipline on White House operations. That included his news conference at Trump Tower in which he doubled down on his blame for “both sides” in the racially charged violence in Charlottesville, Va., and his campaign rally speech in Arizona on Tuesday when he accused the news media of mischaracterizing his statements. Mr. Kelly had urged Mr. Trump to deliver a more somber, traditional statement the day before. And he and other advisers had urged the president to avoid taking questions from the news media at Trump Tower, a request that the president ignored. Before Mr. Trump’s rally in Arizona, aides prepared a sober set of remarks for him to deliver about unity, and sought to redirect his focus after he learned of a Times report about his relationship with Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader. Mr. Trump, who trusts few people and adjusts to new advisers gradually, railed at his new chief of staff over the story, according to one person close to the president. Still, the memos have brought comfort to a number of Mr. Trump’s advisers who have sought structure in a Wild West environment. And they have provided guardrails where few existed. “General Kelly is instilling processes to ensure that the president has the information and analysis he needs to make decisions,” said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The memos were follow-ups to themes that Mr. Kelly touched on during a conference call with senior staff members in which he went through a menu of items related to how the president receives information, how he makes decisions, how meetings with him are scheduled, and how speeches are scheduled and written. Photo The effect so far has been, at times, a more pronounced split-screen between the president’s public behavior and his staff’s more structured approach. But inside the West Wing, several aides said they felt more protected by an established process. In one of the memos, White House aides were told that all materials prepared for the president must go first to Mr. Porter for vetting and clearance. Then Mr. Kelly must sign off on them before they go to Mr. Trump’s desk. That includes news articles, according to West Wing officials who described the memos’ content — of particular importance, given the propensity for some of Mr. Trump’s staff to slip him news accounts from dubious sources that shape his thinking or prompt him to cite unreliable or inaccurate information. The process for documents with legal implications is somewhat more rigorous, although a version of it has been in place since Mr. Priebus was chief of staff.

For instance, the draft of an executive order will go through several stages of development, involving the White House Counsel’s Office and vetting by relevant staff and agency officials. Then it will go to Mr. Kelly for final approval before it is given to the president. Mr. Priebus had tried to take firmer control of that process after Mr. Trump’s first week in office, when Stephen K. Bannon, the recently departed chief strategist, and Stephen Miller, the president’s senior policy adviser, pushed across the president’s desk two orders redesigning the National Security Council, and putting in place the first, court-contested travel ban on seven predominantly Muslim countries. In the second memo, Mr. Kelly and Mr. Porter set up a system for deciding policy issues that have a legal aspect, such as executive orders, to ensure that all sides of the issue are heard. All decisions made in meetings will be formalized in memos, and they are to follow the process of approval by first Mr. Porter and then Mr. Kelly. That process is expected to curtail freelancing and hijacking of decisions by West Wing aides. Mr. Bannon was often accused of taking advantage of the loose process, but Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his daughter, Ivanka Trump, who both work in the West Wing, have also frustrated their colleagues for months by going directly to the president on specific issues. On Mr. Kelly’s first day on the job, he held a small meeting with top aides to the president after a fuller staff meeting. He told them that Oval Office access to Mr. Trump, which was once nearly universal to people coming through the West Wing, would be strictly limited to appointments only. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The exceptions, Mr. Kelly said, were the president’s wife and his 11-year-old son. And, he added, turning to Ivanka Trump, who was seated near him, the president’s eldest daughter, if she was speaking to him as a daughter and not a member of his staff. Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump quickly gave in to Mr. Kelly’s new system, two White House officials said. Since Mr. Trump returned from a working vacation at his golf club in New Jersey, the newly renovated West Wing has taken on a more formal air. Not only is the door to the Oval Office closed, preventing passers-by from catching the president’s eye, but a corridor door leading to the president’s office has also been kept closed. Mr. Trump, who often complained about Mr. Priebus, appears to have absorbed the need for one person to run the staff. The changes Mr. Kelly has put in place have resulted in a more streamlined, functional government, administration officials said. But Mr. Trump, presidential experts say, has shown he is immune to efforts to bring lasting change to his own behavior. And that could ultimately undermine Mr. Kelly’s mission. “Let’s assume for the moment that Trump has learned the first big lesson of his first six months, which is that you have to empower the White House chief of staff to be a real gatekeeper,” said Chris Whipple, author of “The Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency.” “What he hasn’t learned, what he has shown no sign of learning, is that governing is completely different from campaigning,” Mr. Whipple said.

Grant and Christopher Columbus?The short answer is: “It. Ulysses Grant’s Tomb in New York. (Getty Images) How did we go, less than a week after racist violence in Charlottesville, Va., from removing statues of Robert E. Lee to talking about obliterating edifices honoring Ulysses S. Grant and Christopher Columbus? The short answer is: “It’s human nature.” But I’ll amplify. “Disasters should not be politicized — it’s about people’s lives and getting their lives rebuilt,” New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was telling Fox News anchor Neil Cavuto the other day. Christie wasn’t talking about the man-made mayhem in Virginia. He was talking about Hurricane Harvey. Yet in the next breath, he settled old scores against Texas senators and congressmen who voted against Hurricane Sandy relief. Christie has a point. And politicizing disasters, whether natural or human-created, has long been a national pastime. This is not always a bad thing. A 1910 forest fire in Washington, Idaho, and Montana — so massive it was called “the Big Burn” — was used by Theodore Roosevelt to create the National Forest Service. The famous 1871 fire that leveled Chicago forever altered the look, politics and character of the Windy City. Chicago’s current mayor, Rahm Emanuel, put it this way after becoming incoming President Obama’s chief of staff: “You never want a serious crisis to go to waste. And what I mean by that is an opportunity to do things that you think you could not do before.” Emanuel cited the squandered chance at promulgating a broader, forward-looking national energy policy after the 1973-1974 oil shocks. “This crisis,” Emanuel said, referring to the 2007-2008 financial meltdown, “provides the opportunity ... to do things that you could not do before.” For this, he was pilloried by conservatives, who called him cynical. But his critics were the cynics. Emanuel had added this point: “The good news ... if you want to see a silver lining, is the problems are big enough that they lend themselves to ideas from both parties for the solution.” Houston Chronicle Managing Editor Vernon Loeb made this point recently while appealing to the better angels of his media colleagues’ natures. Loeb said that the supposed spat between the Democratic mayor of Houston and the Republican governor of Texas was largely invented. The editor focused on global warming, which may or not be relevant to Hurricane Harvey. Perhaps the problem is Houston’s unrestrained urban sprawl. Maybe this is just a very bad storm. But his instinct to think bigger is laudable — and increasingly rare. Advertisement Which brings us to Charlottesville. What took place in that Virginia college town three weeks ago raises profound public policy questions far beyond the fate of Confederate statues. Is the pernicious idea emanating from campuses’ identity politics — namely, that politically incorrect speech is “violence” — encouraging actual violence? Conversely, does the sight of 200 white men carrying torches and firearms while chanting about Jews and blood and soil suggest a limit to First Amendment protections? Why are police around the country letting masked anarchists physically attack conservative speakers? Is a U.S. president duty-bound to speak about race relations more thoughtfully and articulately than Donald Trump has done? But whether the challenge is a historic flood or a small stream of hate-filled racists, there’s always the next fundraising letter to go out, the next election to be won. Take the Sierra Club, for example. When presidential aide Stephen Bannon left the White House, this tax-exempt group expended exactly five words dealing with the environment (“withdrawing from the Paris Agreement”) in a vitriolic personal attack on him. The rest had nothing to do with conservation. On Friday, the Sierra Club used Hurricane Harvey to attack Trump — over immigration. Such vitriol may help raise money, but it doesn’t solve problems. I suspect problem-solving wasn’t interim NAACP President Derrick Johnson’s goal when he blamed the Trump administration for creating a climate where hate groups “feel comfortable to walk in public without the hoods anymore.” This was the bookend statement, equally clueless, to the president’s assertion that “some very fine people” marched in Charlottesville in support of Robert E. Lee’s statute. Christopher Cantwell, one of the “very fine people” leading that march, told a reporter that Trump disgusts him, if for no other reason than that his daughter Ivanka is married to Jared Kushner, who’s Jewish. “I don’t think that you could feel about race the way that I do,” Cantwell said, “and watch that Kushner bastard walk around with that beautiful girl, OK?” Meanwhile, the identity politics professionals on the left were invoking purity tests of their own. It was almost as if they were in league with the racist loons in Charlottesville. Los Angeles’ City Council responded to Charlottesville by replacing Columbus Day with “Indigenous Peoples Day.” This was just the kind of slippery slope Trump warned about, and many Italian-Americans were not happy. You wonder where it all ends, or if it ever will. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called for a review of “all symbols of hate” on city property. The mayor, who is himself Italian-American, refused to rule out bringing down the iconic cast of the Genoese mariner whose statue adorns Columbus Circle, a Manhattan landmark. That day, Hizzoner was ambushed by local CBS reporter Marcia Kramer, who suggested that de Blasio take aim at Grant’s Tomb because the Union general — the general who defeated Robert E. Lee — “is regarded by some as anti-Semitic.” “In 1862, he signed General Order 11, which expelled Jews from Kentucky, Tennessee and Mississippi,” Kramer said. “I wonder if you think someone who did that, given the large number of Jews who live in New York, he should be buried here,” she asked the mayor. “I’m not familiar with that history,” de Blasio replied. There’s no reason he should be, because that’s not history, it’s a caricature. Grant did issue a hasty, ill-considered edict banning Jews from his military district. It was so out of character that his officers ignored it, and Abe Lincoln promptly rescinded it. Grant’s lapse in judgment became, briefly, a campaign issue when he ran for president in 1868. He handled it by apologizing publicly and privately. As president, Grant appointed more Jews to his administration than any of his predecessors and sent an envoy to Bucharest to support victims of anti-Jewish persecution. When he died, Grant was mourned in synagogues throughout the country. Here’s another notorious wartime edict the guardians of “marginalized people” might consider: Executive Order 9066. It was issued on Feb. 19, 1942, by Franklin D. Roosevelt. Lincoln wasn’t around to reverse it, and FDR’s order resulted in 110,000 Japanese-Americans or legal residents of Japanese descent being sent to internment camps. Are progressives willing to go after FDR in their sanitization efforts? That would break the Democratic Party in two. U.S. Grant offers another lesson — in prudence, if not political correctness. For our current president or any contemporary politician inclined to respond off-the-cuff or use social media to impart half-baked policies regarding race or religion, General Order 11 is a useful reminder. Grant spoke to this himself. “I do not sustain that order,” he rued later. “It would never have been issued if it had not been telegraphed the moment it was penned, and without reflection.” Carl M.

President Donald Trump repeatedly vowed during the 2016 presidential campaign that he’d only hire “the best people in the world” for his administration. Now, with many of his “best people’ ousted from the Cabinet and other high-level positions, CNN’s Anderson Cooper is wondering what happened to that pledge. “If the president hires only the best people, why aren’t they still on the job?” Cooper asked on Tuesday night. “Why have so many left the administration? Why are others serving under ethical clouds?

{"global_context": "On April 27, Kim Jong Un crossed the demarcation line that for 68 years has divided North Korea and South Korea. The crossing was first ever by a North Korean leader within the 4-kilometer-wide (2 1/2-mile) Demilitarized Zone that runs along the countries’ shared border. Kim and South Korea President Moon Jae-in then met at an area called the Joint Security Area -- more commonly known as Panmunjom. Now U.S. President Donald Trump is proposing that his upcoming meeting with Kim be held there as well.1. What is Panmunjom?. On April 27, Kim Jong Un crossed the demarcation line that for 68 years has divided North Korea and South Korea. The crossing was first ever by a North Korean leader within the 4-kilometer-wide (2 1/2-mile) Demilitarized Zone that runs along the countries’ shared border. Kim and South Korea President Moon Jae-in then met at an area called the Joint Security Area -- more commonly known as Panmunjom. Now U.S. President Donald Trump is proposing that his upcoming meeting with Kim be held there as well. 1. What is Panmunjom? Once a farming enclave, Panmunjom became known as a “truce village” for hosting hundreds of talks between the two Koreas, which are technically still at war because an armistice, not a peace treaty, was reached at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. in 1953. Panmunjom sits on the 38th parallel, a line drawn by the former Soviet Union and the U.S. after World War II to separate the countries. It has served as ground zero for much of the peninsula’s six decades of turmoil, including bloody clashes, high-profile defections -- and the regular dashing of hopes for peace. It’s an area that’s home to a small enclave of buildings and makeshift huts. 2. What does Panmunjom mean? It was originally called “nul ban ri,” or plank-door village, so-called because the house doors and bridges were made from planks of wood. When the village became the site of talks during the Korean War, Chinese officials labeled it with traditional Chinese characters, which when pronounced in Korean sounded like Panmunjom -- and that stuck. 3. Where did Moon and Kim meet? The first talks between leaders of the two Koreas in more than 11 years took place within the Panmunjom grounds at a building called Peace House. A symbol of previous South Korean governments’ hopes for improved relations, it’s a three-story building built in 1989 for the specific purpose of hosting talks between the countries and controlled by the United Nations. 4. What did Trump say? In a Twitter posting, he noted that several countries have been considered to host his planned meeting with Kim, “but would Peace House/Freedom House, on the Border of North & South Korea, be a more Representative, Important and Lasting site than a third party country? Just asking!” 5. Can tourists visit Panmunjom? It’s easier for foreign passport holders than it is for South Koreans. Overseas visitors can sign up with tour companies sanctioned by the United Nations. For South Koreans, applications are vetted by the country’s spy agency, the National Intelligence Service, and the process can take up to four months. Until the early 2000s, the agency operated a hotline for “anti-communism consulting” as a mandatory procedure for applicants. 6. And what’s that like? TripAdvisor users give it 4 1/5 stars out of five. “Surreal” is a word many tourists use to describe the experience. A dress code bans ripped jeans, sleeveless shirts, crop tops, tank tops, and shirts with “defamatory or provocative” wording. “Gangster and hip hop-like baggy pants or sweaters, leather vests and pants” are also not allowed. During the bus ride up a six-lane highway -- constructed in case the countries reunify -- tour guides explain that dozens of overhead bridges aren’t bridges at all but anti-tank concrete barricades designed to counter a North Korean attack. Once at the village, U.S. soldiers escort tour groups to view armed South and North Korean guards standing face-to-face. 7. Has there been any trouble at Panmunjom? There have been a number of deadly clashes. The most infamous came in 1976 when ax-wielding North Korean soldiers attacked a group of U.S. soldiers who were cutting down a tree in the village. Two Americans were killed. Several North Koreans have fled their country via Panmunjom, including last year when a guard sprinted across the border as fellow guards chased, inflicting half a dozen gun shot wounds on the defector. --With assistance from Andy Sharp To contact the reporter on this story: Jihye Lee in Seoul at jlee2352@bloomberg.net.

Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. Jan. 31, 2019, 2:04 AM GMT By Lauren Egan BRUNSWICK, Ohio — Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio kicked off his “Dignity of Work” tour in record-setting freezing temperatures here Wednesday night, focusing on worker rights and attacking Donald Trump for “phony populism.” “[Trump] uses his phony populism to distract from the fact that he has used the White House to enrich billionaires like himself,” Brown told a crowd of over 300 supporters. “Real populism is not racist. It’s never anti-Semitic,” Brown said, adding that true populists “don’t rip babies from their families at the border.” Following its launch in Brown’s home state of Ohio, the tour heads to Iowa for a weekend of meet-and-greet events and roundtable discussions. The senator will also make stops in the key early-voting primary states of New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina before making an official announcement of his decision whether or not to launch a presidential bid in March. “The dignity of work means hard work should pay off for everyone, no matter who you are or what kind of work you do,” Brown said Wednesday. “Corporate profits have soared. Executive compensation has exploded. Workers are producing more than ever before, but their wages are flat. Washington doesn’t even understand what collective bargaining is all about.” Brown won his first campaign in 1974 at 22 years old when he was elected to the Ohio state legislature. He then became Ohio’s secretary of state and went on to win a House seat in 1992 where he served for 14 years. In 2006, Brown beat out the Republican incumbent by 12 points to win a seat in the Senate, where he is now serving his third term. In Brunswick Wednesday night, those in the audience told NBC News that their support for Brown boiled down to his consistency. “He was my congressman when I was growing up,” said Stephen Hanudel, an Ohio criminal defense attorney. “He’s always been for economic justice. He’s always been consistent. He doesn’t just pay lip service.” “I think he would make a good president,” said Skip Pollak, a retired teamster. “He is for the people, for the workers. Always has been.” Brown will be joined by his wife Connie Schultz, a Pulitzer-Prize winning columnist, in Cresco, Iowa Thursday evening for his first out-of-state stop on the tour.

{"global_context": "For the first time in more than two years, Illinois has a budget and public schools are funded. Gov. Bruce Rauner on Thursday signed a school-funding compromise that steers more state money to Chicago Public Schools but also increases school choice through tax credits to help parents pay for private-school tuition. The budget impasse has dominated talk about Springfield since 2015. Nasty politics between Rauner and House Speaker Michael Madigan captivated audiences. Suddenly a bipartisan compromise emerged and things seem to have returned to \"normal.\" Now what? Rauner's insistence on reforms as part of a budget deal contributed to the stalemate. With all the coverage of the drama and brinksmanship over the budget and school funding, some may have missed news that parts of Rauner's \"turnaround agenda\" were enacted. Procurement reform is one. Rauner signed Senate Bill 8 into law Aug. 9 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The measure streamlines the purchasing process for state institutions and, in time, could save the state $250 million to $300 million a year, Rauner said. \"This bill can benefit the U of I as quickly as any other entity in the state, by immediately allowing purchases to go forward to get research projects off and running,\" Rauner said, Illinois Public Radio reported. Another measure makes it easier for local officials to consolidate some of the state's nearly 7,000 units of government. Rauner signed Senate Bill 3 into law on Aug. 14. \"Senate Bill 3 expands the ability of townships to consolidate and create greater efficiencies for taxpayers,\" state Sen. Michael Hastings, D-Tinley Park, said in a statement. \"The plan allows adjacent townships to merge, allows townships to take over the duties of smaller township road districts, removes the current cap on township size and allows voters to approve the dissolution of townships that are coterminous with a municipality.\" Coterminous means having the same boundaries. I think it would be great if Illinois could eliminate some of its townships, road districts, sanitary districts, mosquito abatement districts, school districts and other taxing bodies. In theory, consolidation should reduce costs by creating efficiencies and lowering overhead expenses. Two small school districts that merge into one, for example, would be able to eliminate at least one superintendent and possibly several other senior administrative positions without reducing the number of teachers. However, the political reality is public-sector employees and local politicians typically resist consolidation efforts. They're motivated by self-preservation. Government jobs typically offer good pay, benefits and pensions. I think labor costs — pensions in particular — remain the biggest reason for high taxes. Yet progress toward pension reform is elusive. There was bipartisan agreement in Springfield on a bill, but the Illinois Supreme Court in 2015 said it was unconstitutional to take away benefits that were already granted. The state's highest court said the same thing in 2016 about a city of Chicago attempt to cut benefits and require workers to pay more toward retirement. You'd think legislators by now would get the message that taxpayers will just have to suck it up and pay those pension costs. The best legislators can do is limit the generosity of benefits to new hires moving forward, or negotiate voluntary concessions from workers. If costs are fixed, some say the best way to ease the taxpayer burden is to grow the state's economy. Rauner often talks about making the state more competitive and attractive to businesses by doing things like lowering the costs of workers compensation. Rauner on Aug. 25 vetoed a measure that would have required insurance companies to obtain state approval to set rates for workers compensation insurance. The insurance industry opposed the bill. Democrats said it was an effort to address some of Rauner's demands, but the governor said it didn't go far enough. There were other notable legislative accomplishments this summer unrelated to Rauner's turnaround agenda. On Aug. 28, Rauner signed the Illinois TRUST Act that prohibits law enforcement authorities from detaining anyone solely because of their immigration status. Also on Aug. 28 Rauner signed a law allowing automatic voter registration whenever an eligible citizen renews a driver's license or state ID. Supporters said the measure makes Illinois a national leader in expanding voting rights and ballot access. I think another significant measure received insufficient attention amid other news. Rauner on Aug. 11 signed a law removing the statute of limitations for felony criminal sexual abuse and sex crimes against children. \"At times, survivors of abuse need time to discover the courage to address these horrific and awful crimes,\" Hastings, the bill's sponsor, said in a statement. \"This new law will put in place the best practices for dealing with sexual assault cases statewide and puts a system in place that will encourage survivors to come forward and receive justice when they are ready to do so.\" These are just a few of the more significant measures the Legislature and governor accomplished this summer. I think it's important to recognize that amid all the talk of gridlock in Springfield and stubbornness on the part of the state's political leaders, some meaningful legislative achievements did advance. In retrospect, I find the two-year budget impasse maddening. What was the point? Legislators and the governor could have saved taxpayers a lot of money if they had reached consensus sooner on a number of things they ended up agreeing upon anyway. I must be missing something, because Rauner repeatedly said the school-funding plan was a \"bailout\" for Chicago. Then Chicago got all that additional funding anyway, \"and more,\" as Mayor Rahm Emanuel said. I think the best way Illinois could ease the tax burden for residents and attract business growth would be to agree upon a comprehensive strategy to reduce the costs of benefits for public-sector workers. You could get everyone at the table — the governor, legislators, local officials, union representatives, judges and legal experts — anyone with a stake in the game. They could hash out exactly what it would take to reduce the number of units of local government, eliminate some public-sector jobs and establish reasonable benchmarks for employees to share the costs of health insurance and retirement benefits. I think it would take honest negotiations and a willingness to bargain, as opposed to threats and other tactics that characterize how leaders seem to manage our perpetual state of crisis. tslowik@tronc.com.

{"global_context": "With Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp in a dead heat for Georgia governor, voter turnout will be a big factor in who wins the office. ATLANTA – The closely contested race for Georgia governor is ending as it began: With the sides accusing each other of manipulation and dirty tricks. Georgia's contentious race for governor is down to the wire with Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp making their last minute attempts to woo voters. The latest polls show Abrams and Kemp in a dead heat and the results could depend on whether Abrams' message of fighting voter suppression has galvanized her supporters, or if Kemp supporters will outnumber them at the polls to keep the state red. Some political analysts say the razor thin race could trigger a runoff election in December if neither candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote, which is required by state law. An Abrams victory would make her the first black woman governor in U.S. history. It would also be a huge win for the Democratic party which hasn't held the gubernatorial seat in Georgia since 2003. Both candidates have boosted campaign efforts in recent days, bringing high profile figures on the campaign trail with them to declare their support. President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence joined Kemp on the campaign trail speaking at rallies in Georgia. Meanwhile, former President Barack Obama and Oprah both visited the state last week to address Abrams supporters. Political experts say the early polling numbers are too close to predict a winner. Charles Bullock, a a professor of political science at the University of Georgia, said Abrams' path to victory will depend on how well she performs with white women voters and whether black voters turn out to support her. \"Abrams needs to do better with white female voters than any other Democrat has in the past to win,\" Bullock said. \"She needs to hope that African Americans turn out at extraordinarily high rates.\" While Abrams and Kemp differ on most of their positions, they both view improving education and school security as a priority. Kemp has vowed to support small businesses, protect rural hospitals, raise teacher pay and stop sanctuary cities. He is also a firm supporter of the second amendment and says he opposes gun control. As Georgia's Secretary of State since 2010, Kemp takes credit for record voter turnout and registration across all demographic groups and a new online voter registration website. “I think people in a lot of areas of our state are just wondering, 'is anybody fighting for us?'” Kemp said in a television interview earlier this year. \"And that’s why I decided to run for governor, because I feel like we need somebody that going to fight for them over the special interests.” Kemp, who also served on the Georgia Senate from 2003-2006, maintains that Abrams is too extreme and too liberal for Georgia. Abrams promises to improve public schools, strengthen gun control, expand Medicaid and generate jobs through small business investment if elected governor. She previously served as House Minority Leader for the Georgia General Assembly and a state representative for the 89th House District. Abrams was the first African American to lead in the House and the first woman to lead either party in the Georgia General Assembly. She touts her record of blocking a tax hike on the poor and middle class while serving in the House. \"People don't care about your party, they care about their lives,\" Abrams said Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press. \"And as the next governor, my goal is going to be to bring everyone together to solve the problems we can solve together.\" Georgia's race for governor has been in the national spotlight with so much controversy surrounding voting rights and the potential for a historic win by Abrams. The race has also turned nasty at times with both campaigns accusing each other of pulling political stunts to distract voters. Abrams, her supporters and voting rights advocates maintain that Kemp has used the \"exact match\" law to suppress black and minority voters and tilt the election in his favor. Groups have filed lawsuits on behalf of the 53,000 people whose voter registrations were placed on hold because the law requires voter registration applications to precisely match information on file with the state's motor vehicle department or the Social Security Administration. Federal judges backed some of their arguments, ruling in court that election officials could not throw out absentee ballots and applications because signatures didn't match. A judge also ruled that voters flagged inaccurately as non-citizens must be allowed to vote when they provide proof of citizenship to poll workers. Kemp has called accusations of voter suppression \"outrageous\" and insists that voters on the pending list will still be able to vote when they present proper identification. On Sunday, Kemp's office announced that it was investigating the Georgia Democratic Party for a failed attempt to hack the state's voter registration system. Kemp has yet to provide evidence for why he suspects Democrats did this. Rebecca DeHart, executive director of the Georgia Democratic Party, said Kemp's \"so-called investigation\" was \"yet another abuse of power by an unethical Secretary of State.\" During a rally Friday at Morehouse College, Obama urged a crowd of 6,600 people to fight voter suppression by exercising their right to vote. He lauded Abrams as \"the most experienced, most qualified candidate in this race.\" \"She's got an incredible track record of fighting for working families,\" Obama said. Trump spoke Sunday afternoon to an energized crowd at a rally in Macon. “Brian Kemp is an incredible fighter and a tireless champion for the people,” Trump says. “He will keep your jobs and wages and rising he will provide great schools and healthcare for your loved one.” Kemp backed out of a scheduled televised debate with Abrams to host the Macon rally with Trump. His campaign says he tried to reschedule but Abrams refused and criticized Kemp for a robbing voters of their last chance to hear the candidates debate.

{"global_context": "Democrats and Trump critics attack the president but fierce criticism also comes from conservatives. Image copyright Reuters The Helsinki summit between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump is over, and after nearly two hours behind closed doors and another hour in front of the press, there's plenty of material to sort through. Leading into the meeting, Democrats were warning Mr Trump to be careful in dealing with his Russian counterpart - with some suggesting that it was unwise for the US president to even hold such an event, given Friday's indictments of 12 Russian military officers for conducting cyber-warfare against the US during the 2016 elections. Many Republicans, on the other hand, were cautiously optimistic that the president would push back against Mr Putin on a range of issues. Congressman Steve Scalise, a Republican house leader, said that Mr Trump entered into the negotiations \"from a position of American strength to combat Russian aggression\". Things went … a bit differently. Here are some key takeaways. 'We're all to blame' Mr Trump, in his first question from an American reporter, was pressed to explain why earlier in the day he had tweeted out that US was to blame for the current tense state of US-Russia relations. In his answer, he stood by his earlier comments and said he held \"both countries responsible\". He said both sides had \"made some mistakes\" - but declined to specifically mention items like the Russian military involvement in Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea, the Novichok chemical attack in southern England and the indictment of Russians for meddling in the US election. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Trump: \"There was nobody to collude with\" Instead, he insisted there was \"no collusion at all\" between his campaign and Russia, conflating charges of election meddling - for which there have been indictments of Russian nationals - with evidence of collusion, which the Mueller probe has not yet alleged. When asked if he would directly condemn Russia and Mr Putin on election meddling, Mr Trump said his intelligence officials - including Director of Intelligence Dan Coats - have told him \"they think it's Russia\". Mr Putin, he continued, just told him it's not Russia. \"I don't see any reason why it would be,\" Mr Trump concluded, apparently leaning toward the Russian professions of innocence over the conclusions of his own government. This has put the US intelligence community in a familiar bind, given Mr Trump's past criticisms. It's a bind, however, for which Trump-appointed leaders, in office for more than a year, are now accountable. Content is not available Mr Coats has issued a statement saying his intelligence community stands by its \"fact-based assessments\" of Russian meddling and their \"ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy\". Later on Monday, the president made an effort, via Twitter, to smooth over ruffled feathers. Mr Mueller has indicted more than two dozen Russians, but Mr Trump still isn't convinced that they're to blame - raising instead questions about the security of Democratic computer servers and FBI bias. The Trump Justice Department, and Mr Mueller's special counsel team, will grind on - Monday afternoon's announcement of a Russian woman indicted for being an undisclosed foreign operative is evidence of that. But Mr Trump's campaign to discredit their work will also continue undeterred. Never Trumpers' outrage Not surprisingly, Mr Trump's performance was greeted with a mix of condemnation and derision from the left. Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called it a \"shameful performance\" that was \"thoughtless, dangerous and weak\". John Brennan, director of the CIA under Barack Obama, said Mr Trump was guilty of treason. Meanwhile, never-Trump conservatives were quick with \"I told you so-s\". Political consultant (and Jeb Bush advisor) Mike Murphy called it a \"dark day\", after tweeting a string of invective. Former 2008 Republican presidential candidate John McCain said it was \"one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory\". \"The damage inflicted by President Trump's naivete, egotism, false equivalence, and sympathy for autocrats is difficult to calculate,\" the Arizona Republican senator, and chair of the Armed Services committee, wrote in a statement. \"But it is clear that the summit in Helsinki was a tragic mistake.\" Image copyright EPA Conservative unease Perhaps most noteworthy is how Mr Trump is being seen among Republicans who are - or were becoming - more sympathetic to Mr Trump. Abby Huntsman, a conservative commentator and daughter of US ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman, tweeted that \"no negotiation is worth throwing your own people and country under the bus\". Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who swings between Trump critic and Trump confidante, was back in the former camp, calling the summit a \"missed opportunity\", a \"bad day for the US\" that will be sign of weakness to Russia. Skip Twitter post by @ellencarmichael Me last week: I didn't vote for Trump last time around, but the economy's definitely going well and the Left is going nuts. Me this week: Back to Square 1. — Ellen L. Carmichael 🇫🇷 (@ellencarmichael) July 16, 2018 Report New York Post columnist Karol Markowicz, who several months ago had written about how pro- and anti-Trump conservatives had to dial back their rhetoric, was blunt. \"You can love Trump, you can be thrilled he vanquished Hillary, you can be right that Obama's foreign policy was clownish, but call it here: this was atrocious and no American president should ever behave this way.\" The Drudge Report had a headline blaring that \"Putin dominates\" the summit. Even on the Fox News cable networks, which are normally Trump's biggest defender and echo chamber, commentators appeared uneasy. Neil Cavuto called the president's performance \"disgraceful\" and said it \"sets us back a lot\". \"There is a growing consensus across the land tonight ... that the president threw the United States under the bus,\" said Fox News White House correspondent John Roberts. Mary Kissel, a member of the Wall Street Journal editorial board, told Fox News audience that \"nothing was achieved\" from the summit. \"The president came off as wanting to have more meetings and going to Putin and asking for Putin's help, when we should be in the position of Putin coming to us and asking us to ease up on him,\" she said. \"Unfortunately, President Putin scored a great propaganda victory.\" This could all blow over, of course. With domestic political battles on the horizon - a Supreme Court confirmation and mid-term election contests - the partisan battle lines could quickly re-form. For a moment, however, there was a hint of doubt and concern and the possibility that, at some point in the future, when political expediency is no longer paramount, Mr Trump could face more significant dissention within his ranks. 'A first important step' This isn't how Mr Trump and his supporters see it. For them, the summit should be framed as the beginning of a larger effort to repair relations between the world's two largest nuclear powers. \"From the earliest days of our republic, American leaders have understood that diplomacy and engagement is preferable to conflict and hostility,\" he said. Mr Putin echoed those sentiments, calling the summit the \"first important step\". With no tangible results from the summit, the two leaders are framing this as the first of many meetings to come Given the American reaction from across the political spectrum, however, future meetings may be difficult to pull off. After a week abroad, Mr Trump on Monday delivered the coup de grace for what has been a highly disruptive week in US foreign affairs. European allies are uneasy. US-Russia relations are uncertain. And the US political world - and even the White House's own communications team - is unsettled. What comes next? That's unknown.

{"global_context": "Puerto Rico’s governor signed an education reform bill Thursday to create charter schools and vouchers and help turn around a department long known for its bureaucracy and struggles to administer dwindling resources. SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Puerto Rico’s governor signed an education reform bill Thursday to create charter schools and vouchers and help turn around a department long known for its bureaucracy and struggles to administer dwindling resources. The bill aims to decentralize the Department of Education and ensure that 70 percent of its budget reaches schools. In addition, it will provide teachers with their first raise in a decade starting next year. Officials said the charter schools pilot program will be implemented in 10 percent of schools across the U.S. territory. The schools have not yet been identified, but those with low academic achievement will be a priority, said Education Secretary Julia Keleher. Meanwhile, the private school vouchers will be limited to 3 percent of students starting in the 2019-2020 academic year. “The reform is focused on providing students with better opportunities,” Keleher said. Puerto Rico has 1,110 public schools and 319,000 students but has seen such numbers drop as people continue to flee to the U.S. mainland amid an 11-year recession. More than 25,000 students have left since Hurricane Maria hit in September, and officials say they expect to lose 54,000 students overall in the next four years. Enrollment already dropped by 78,000 students over the past four years. The bill faced more than 600 amendments as teachers, parents and legislators debated the proposed reform. Critics said it could lead to corruption and mismanagement of resources. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said in a phone interview that she was pleased with the bill’s amendments. “We’re still disappointed that charters and vouchers will siphon off some of the much needed funds in Puerto Rico,” she said. “At the same time, the Senate put the brakes on this open-ended process and required standards for the charters so they could not be an open invitation for fraud, mismanagement and profit-making.” Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

{"global_context": "In his statement to reporters, Tillerson stressed that U.S. leadership starts with diplomacy. Outgoing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson delivered a statement to reporters at the State Department after President Trump fired him Tuesday. Absent in his speech were remarks about Trump’s “America First” strategy or any comments about the president. Instead, Tillerson thanked State Department employees for their work regarding North Korea and stressed the importance of allies and partners. Here is what he said: Afternoon all. I received a call today from the president of the United States a little after noon time from Air Force One, and I've also spoken to White House Chief of Staff [John F.] Kelly to ensure we have clarity as to the days ahead. What is most important is to ensure an orderly and smooth transition during a time that the country continues to face significant policy and national security challenges. As such, effective at the end of the day, I'm delegating all responsibilities of the Office of the Secretary to Deputy Secretary of State [John J.] Sullivan. My commission as secretary of state will terminate at midnight, March 31. Between now and then, I will address a few administrative matters related to my departure and work towards a smooth and orderly transition for Secretary of State-designate Mike Pompeo. I’m encouraging my policy planning team and undersecretaries and assistant secretaries, those confirmed, as well as those in acting positions, to remain at their post and continue our mission at the State Department and working with the interagency process. I will be meeting members of my front office team and policy planning later today to thank them for their service. They have been extraordinarily dedicated to our mission, which includes promoting values that I view as being very important to the safety and security of our State Department personnel: accountability, which means treating each other with honesty and integrity, and respect for one another. Most recently, in particular, to address challenges of sexual harassment within the department. I want to speak now to my State Department colleagues and to our interagency colleagues and partners at DOD and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, most particularly, to my Foreign Service officers and civil service colleagues. We all take the same oath of office, whether you’re a career employee or a political appointee, we are all bound by that common commitment to support and defend the Constitution, to bear true faith and allegiance to the same, and to faithfully discharge the duties of our office. As a State Department, we are bound together by that oath. We remain steadfast here in Washington and in posts across the world, many of whom are in danger-placed situations without their families. The world needs selfless leaders like these: ready to work with long-standing allies, new emerging partners and allies, who now, many are struggling as democracies, and in some cases are dealing with human tragedy, crisis of natural disasters — literally crawling themselves out of those circumstances. These are experiences that no lecture hall in an academic environment or a think tank can teach you. Only by people going to the front lines to serve can they develop this kind of talent. To the men and women in uniform, I’m told for the first time in most people’s memory the Department of State and Department of Defense have a close working relationship where we all agree the U.S. leadership starts with diplomacy. The men and women in uniform at the Department of Defense and the leadership of Secretary [of Defense Jim] Mattis and Gen. [Joseph F.] Dunford protect us as Americans and our way of life daily, at home and abroad. As an all-volunteer military, they do it for the love of country, they do it for you, and they do it for me — and for no other reason. As Americans, we are all eternally grateful to each of them, and we honor their sacrifices. The rewarding part of having leadership and partnerships in place is that you can actually get some things done, and I want to give recognition to the State Department and our partners for a few of their accomplishments under this administration. First, working with allies, we exceeded the expectations of almost everyone with the DPRK maximum pressure campaign with the announcement on my very first trip as secretary of state to the region that the era of strategic patience was over, and we commenced the steps to dramatically increase not just the scope but the effectiveness of the sanctions. The department undertook a global campaign to bring partners and allies on board in every country around the world with every embassy and mission raising this to the highest levels, and in every meeting I’ve had throughout the year, this has been on the agenda to discuss: the adoption of the South Asia strategy, with a conditions-based military plan as the tool to compel the Taliban to reconciliation and peace talks with the Afghan government, finally equipped our military planners with a strategy which they can execute as opposed to a succession of 16 one-year strategies. This clear military commitment attracted the support of allies broadly and equipped our diplomats with a whole new level of certainty around how to prepare for the peace talks and achieve the final objectives. In other areas where progress has been made, much work remains. In Syria, we did achieve important cease-fires and stabilizations which we know has saved thousands of lives. There’s more to be done in Syria, particularly with respect to achieving the peace, as well as stabilizing Iraq, and seeing a healthy government installed more broadly in the entire global campaign to defeat ISIS. Nothing is possible without allies and partners, though. Much work remains to establish a clear view of the nature of our future relationship with China. How should we deal with one another over the next 50 years and ensure a period of prosperity for all of our peoples, free of conflict between two very powerful nations? And much work remains to respond to the troubling behavior and actions on the part of the Russian government. Russia must assess carefully as to how its actions are in the best interest of the Russian people and of the world more broadly. Continuing on their current trajectory is likely to lead to greater isolation on their part, a situation which is not in anyone’s interest. So to my colleagues in the State Department and the interagency: Much remains to be done to achieve our mission on behalf of the American people, with allies and with partners. I close by thanking all for the privilege of serving beside you for the last 14 months. Importantly, to the 300-plus million Americans: Thank you for your devotion to a free and open society, to acts of kindness towards one another, to honesty and the quiet hard work that you do every day to support this government with your tax dollars. All of us, we know, want to leave this place as a better place for the next generation. I now return to private life as a private citizen, as a proud American, proud of the opportunity I’ve had to serve my country. God bless all of you. God bless the American people. God bless America.

{"global_context": "President Trump accused Iran of collaborating with North Korea to strengthen their missile technology Saturday evening in a Twitter post criticizing the 2015 nuclear agreement between the U.S., Iran and five other nations. President Trump accused Iran of collaborating with North Korea to strengthen their missile technology Saturday evening in a Twitter post criticizing the 2015 nuclear agreement between the U.S., Iran and five other nations. \"Iran just test-fired a Ballistic Missile capable of reaching Israel,\" Trump wrote. \"They are also working with North Korea. Not much of an agreement we have!\" Nonproliferation experts have long suspected North Korea and Iran are sharing know-how when it comes to their rogue missile programs. Earlier this month, CIA Director Mike Pompeo told Fox News' \"Special Report with Bret Baier\" that Iran would \"certainly be someone who would be willing to pay\" for that expertise. \"The North Koreans have a long history of being proliferators and sharing their knowledge, their technology, their capacities around the world,\" Pompeo said. \"As North Korea continues to improve its ability to do longer-range missiles and to put nuclear weapons on those missiles, it is very unlikely if they get that capability that they wouldn't share it with lots of folks.\" Trump posted the tweet hours after Iran claimed to have successfully tested a new ballistic missile capable of reaching parts of the Middle East, including Israel. The missile, known as the Khoramshahr, has a range of 1,250 miles and is based on a North Korean design. A similar missile was tested in late January and blew up 600 miles after launch. The Iranian test-launch constituted a direct challenge to Trump, who last month signed a bill imposing mandatory penalties on those involved in Iran's ballistic missile program and anyone who does business with them. Trump has vowed repeatedly to take a tougher line toward Iran than his predecessor, threatening at various times to renegotiate or even dismantle the nuclear deal, and shoot Iranian boats out of the water if they provoke U.S. naval vessels in the Persian Gulf. On Wednesday, Trump told reporters that he had made a decision about whether or not to pull out of the nuclear deal, but declined to say what it was. Earlier this week, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani vowed Iran would strengthen its missile capabilities without asking for any country’s permission, just days after Trump accused Iran in an address to the United Nations General Assembly of exporting violence to Yemen, Syria, and other parts of the Middle East. In that speech, Trump criticized the nuclear deal as \"one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.\" \"Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States,\" the president proclaimed, \"and I don’t think you’ve heard the last of it, believe me.\" The nuclear deal between Iran and world powers does not strictly prohibit Iran from developing missiles but after the deal came into effect last year, the U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution calling on Iran not to take any actions related to ballistic missiles \"designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons\" for eight years. Iranian officials have argued that the measure only applies to missiles specifically designed to carry nuclear warheads. Fox News' Lucas Tomlinson and the Associated Press contributed to this report.

{"global_context": "The California Legislature continues to try to “fix” California’s common interest developments, yet elected representatives still do not understand the dynamic of volunteer-run communities or what they need. Senate Bill 1265 is the latest example. Authored by Sen. Bob Wieckowski, a Democrat from the 10th District in East Bay area, the bill seeks to revamp the HOA election process for the second time in 13 years. This bill would bar any HOA board candidacy eligibility requirements — with the only exception being candidates must be community members. Many associations ban delinquent members, non-resident members, or members suing the HOA, from serving as directors. Other HOAs ban co-owners from running. Should this bill pass, all those sensible limitations on eligibility would be illegal. The bill also dramatically increases the technical requirements that must be followed during the election process and would change Civil 5145(a) to require courts to overturn an election if they are shown to be in error. (The current statute says a judge can overturn the election). The bill also begins with a declaration that HOAs are quasi-governments, just like cities, functioning like cities “in almost every way.” This is a dangerous and false statement. Try to tell the-24 unit building in Whittier that they are just like a city! HOAs are neighborhoods, which have been given via covenants — simple tools — to enable shared living. They don’t have courts or large staffs of full-time employees. And their job is not to enforce all applicable laws – just to make sure neighbors are good neighbors and the governing documents are followed and the community preserved. The bill also would require HOAs to store outer ballot envelopes, which are signed by the voters, for later inspection and copying. Members may be justifiably concerned about their signatures being copied and distributed. The corporation code of Section 7341 allows a nonprofit board to suspend member voting rights. Many HOAs use this process in response to assessment delinquencies, reasoning it makes no sense to allow a homeowner to vote when they are not paying their share of the association’s expenses. However, SB1265, if it became law, would make that illegal, and override code 7341. Large and mid-sized HOAs have in recent years, for the most part, learned to conduct elections following the huge increase in technicalities of 2005. However, thousands of smaller HOAs either are unaware of the law (Civil Code 510-5145) or ignore it completely. This bill would guarantee bad neighbors the right to run for the board and dramatically increase the number of HOA elections set aside on technicalities. Sen. Wieckowski clearly has not served as an HOA director, or he would never have agreed to author SB 1265. The bill will discourage HOA elections and increase election disputes rather than decrease them. Small- to mid-size associations need help regarding HOA elections. Most small associations struggle without professional management, much less legal counsel. They need simpler elections, not the kind of elections presented by SB 1265. The bill is scheduled for a committee hearing May 2. Homeowners, board members and managers may want to make their voices heard on this matter. Looking ahead, my next column will review several other bills of interest to HOAs.

{"global_context": "Twelve Los Angeles police officers in Sunland last year fired numerous times at a suspect who no longer posed a threat, a review of the fatal incident by the Los Angeles Police Commission found. The review found that police continued to fire their weapons when the suspect — who did shoot at officers and a police helicopter — was no longer armed. Officers were also too far away to determine if the suspect posted a threat, the report found. The Los Angeles Police Commission released its report Friday that examined the fatal shooting of burglary suspect Anthony Soderberg, 29, of Shadow Hills on May 8, 2017. Release of the report came a few days after survivors of Soderberg filed suit against the Los Angeles Police Department. The shooting occurred near the 11300 block of Alethea Drive after an hours-long standoff with LAPD officers. The incident was the first time the department used snipers in a helicopter to shoot a suspect, although officers also shot at the suspect from the ground. The 40-page report gives some insight behind the Commission’s 3-1 vote Wednesday that found 12 of the 13 involved officers did not act within policy in using lethal force. Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck had argued that the 13 officers involved in the incident acted within policy. Beck said “that an officer with similar training and experience (as the 13 officers involved) would reasonably believe Soderberg’s actions presented an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury and that the use of lethal force would be objectively reasonable,” according to his April 26 report to the Commission. The Commission’s review summarizes the incident in which a woman reported she awoke to find an unknown man in the kitchen. She said the man was “speaking to himself and referencing Jesus, and was possibly under the influence or mentally ill,” the panel’s report said. She fled through a bedroom window and called 911, the panel’s report said. She told officers on scene she did not see the man with a weapon but said there was a pistol, shotgun, rifle and ammunition in the house, the panel’s report said. The house was located on higher ground, positioned atop a mountain ridge and surrounded by hillside terrain, the Commmission report said. Officers were concerned that Soderberg had a “tactical advantage due to his elevated position,” the panel’s report said. The officers saw the man inside, set up a perimeter and requested more resources. According to Beck’s report to the Commission, a commander believed Soderberg was in a position where it would be “very dangerous for anybody to try to contain or engage him on foot.” The “aerial platform shooting” offered the ability to control the terrain from the air “and it was appropriate,” Beck wrote. About 1:05 p.m., an officer on the ground first fired two or three rounds when he saw Soderberg holding a blue steel handgun about 30 feet away, the Commission report said. That officer acted within department policy, the Commission found. The panel report concluded that Soderberg posed a threat when he was armed with a pistol and barricaded in the house. But he was no longer a threat when he later wound up outside the house, unarmed, as officers continued to shoot, the panel report found. While inside, he ignored officers’ requests to surrender, fired a number of times and declared he was going to kill officers, the panel report said. At one point, he went to the kitchen doorway and pointed the gun toward the sky as if to track the helicopter’s orbit, the panel report said. About 1:08 p.m., Soderberg fired into the sky before going back in the house, the panel report said. Multiple shots were fired about 1:48 p.m. once Soderberg emerged from the house after officers deployed hot gas in the residence, the panel report said. He was no longer armed at that point, the panel report said. Soderberg wound up in a ravine and officers continued to fire about 2:40 p.m., the panel report said. The gunfire stopped about 2:42 p.m., the panel report said. Nine of the 12 officers said they saw Soderberg holding a gun or dark object in rationalizing the gunfire once he was outside, the panel report said. One of those officers fired 14 rounds from the helicopter that was some 75 to 85 yards away, the panel report said. The Commission said he was no longer a threat because he was unarmed at that point. “The evidence in this case does not support the reasonableness of any of these reported observations. There were no firearms recovered outside the residence and there were no dark objects identified that could be construed as weapon,” the Commission report said. The three other officers were about 189 yards away on the roadway and looking up the hillside when they fired their weapons, the Commission’s report said. The officers’ observations “were made from a considerable distance, which would have limited their ability to accurately observe and assess” Soderberg’s actions, the Commission report said. The Commission found that officers and command staff acted within policy with regard to tactics, drawing and exhibiting a weapon and less lethal use of force. On May 8, Soderberg’s family attorney Greg Kirakosian filed a federal lawsuit alleging excessive force and wrongful death against the Police Department. The lawsuit claims that when Soderberg emerged from the house he was “crawling, struggling, gasping for air and unarmed.” The suit also alleges that “several of the witnesses to the incident have contradicted the official version given by the LAPD.” “The use of deadly force was excessive and objectively unreasonable under the circumstances,” the lawsuit alleges. LAPD attorneys have not yet filed an official response to the suit.

{"global_context": "U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO) has told multiple reporters he's undecided on the latest GOP bill to kill Obamacare, in part, as he told KOA radio this mor... U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO) has told multiple reporters he's undecided on the latest GOP bill to kill Obamacare, in part, as he told KOA radio this morning, because he wants to see \"whether Colorado is better or worse\" under the legislation. But every analysis of the bill so far, like the one from the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, shows that Colorado will be worse off. Gov. John Hickenlooper told reporters yesterday that the legislation would cost the state $800 million to $1 billion in federal health-care dollars. And it's widely predicted that millions of people would lose health insurance under the latest GOP bill, just as they would under previous GOP proposals that upend Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for children, elderly, disabled, and other poor people. So it's hard to know what information Gardner is waiting for. In fact, when asked directly by Denver Post political reporter Mark Matthews what specific information he's looking for, Gardner replied, \"just additional information.\" Strangely, though, Gardner told KDMT’s Jimmy Sengenberger last month that the Cassidy-Graham bill would put the country in the \"right direction\" on health care and \"could result in a 42 percent increase in funding for the state of Colorado.\" Gardner: But it does sound like [Cassidy-Graham] could result in a 42% increase in funding for the state of Colorado. And so, I just need to learn more about it.” Gardner did not divulge where he got this information and a call to his office was not immediately returned today. On KOA radio, Gardner said of the latest Obamacare replacement bill, \"I hope it has bipartisan participation and support.\" It's not clear why Gardner or anyone would express hope for the unreal outcome of bipartisan support, given the GOP's seven-year partisan campaign to kill Obamacare. Could Gardner possibly be trying to score political points with rhetoric that's completely divorced from reality? Here are Gardner's full comments from KOA, followed by his comments to The Post. GARDNER: Yeah, there is going to be a hearing on this, I believe on Monday, next week. So, we’ll have an open hearing which is something that I have encouraged to have happen. I hope it has bipartisan participation and support. Look, I think one of the things we need to do is focus on driving down the cost of healthcare. And I have confidence that states can come up with solutions do just that, because [inaudible—“when it comes to”?] states like Colorado come up with really good solutions. It is not always just Washington. And so, I’ve got more information that we’re seeking. There’s some information that we don’t have yet, in terms of the numbers of what it means and its impact to Colorado. And whether Colorado is better or worse, we’ve got to figure that out. HOST APRIL ZESBAUGH: But Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of your colleagues, says if we don't effectively tweak Obamacare we’re on our way to a single-payer system. Do you share that sentiment? GARDNER: I am concerned that there is a great support right now for a single-payer system. It is a $32 trillion tab on Bernie Sanders’ legislation that he introduced, on Medicare For All. The Colorado voters defeated – that’s the single-payer system, that’s socialized medicine, that’s just a code word they’re using -- but if you look at Colorado, we defeated the single-payer healthcare system -- the Medicare For All system -- 80% to 20%, at the same time Hillary Clinton was getting elected in November. So, it’s something Colorado voters have already rejected. And I am concerned that, left on its own, the Affordable Care Act could lead to some who want to do single-payer.

{"global_context": "Conservative institutions have embraced Bannon's political slaughter not for his past sins but because he criticized the president. That's chilling. Conservative institutions have embraced Bannon's political slaughter not for his past sins but because he criticized the president. That's chilling. Steve Bannon (Photo: Alex Brandon, AP) Steve Bannon — the loathed architect of President Trump’s alt-right hate machine, Breitbart lies, racism, misogyny and Twitter thug troll factory — is banished to political Siberia. It was swift and decisive. Bannon is a deplorable human being who has no business being in a position of power or having the ear of any lawmaker. But as deplorable as he may be, his destruction by Trump and the sycophantic army Bannon helped incubate should frighten every American. Why? Because it’s not why he was taken down and kicked to the curb. The former top campaign strategist, former National Security Council member (appointed by Trump) and former Breitbart News chairman has been given the heave-ho by pretty much the entire Trump establishment. Yet just days ago, he was king and kingmaker, second only to Trump, and viewed by many as Trump’s Svengali. More: Trump team collusion with Russia? Ukraine connection may hold key. More: Michael Wolff book: Bannon's downfall with Trump, Breitbart and the Mercers? At Breitbart, Bannon created an online haven — a fertile safe space — for white nationalists and anti-Semites. Then he mobilized them behind a reality show host/failed casino owner/conspiracy theorist buffoon who won the GOP presidential nomination, largely because his outrageous clown show was ratings gold. Many right-wing media figures, authors and commentators had made their fame and fortune with a Clinton in the White House. They likely wanted a repeat of that success and no doubt believed a Trump nomination ensured a Hillary Clinton win. I’m guessing more than a few publishers have a stale anti-President Hillary book proposal or two gathering dust in a drawer. Bannon openly campaigned to tear down American institutions, the Republican Party and the government. His white nationalism was first ignored, then tolerated and even welcomed by some. When Trump brought him to the White House as a top aide, Bannon's appointment was cheered by leaders of the Ku Klux Klan, the American Nazi Party and other white nationalist groups. Backed by the power of enormous amounts of money from the uber-wealthy Mercers, Bannon and Breitbart were being normalized. They worked to normalize Trump. Such was Bannon’s ability to infiltrate society with his and Trump’s morally reprehensible attitudes, they both vigorously campaigned for Alabama's Senate candidate Roy Moore — who was credibly accused by multiple women of molesting them when they were adolescents and teens. Moore led in the polls for weeks before his defeat. Bannon is now ruined because in a few moments of uncharacteristic truth-telling to Fire and Fury author Michael Wolff, he shared the identical sentiments and concerns as his colleagues and most of his fellow citizens. He described suspicions and assumptions that nearly all of Washington, the press corps, Congress and many Americans share: that Trump knew full well his relatives and staff were meeting in Trump Tower with the Russians to get dirt on Hillary Clinton. Conspiracy and collusion. Let that sink in for a moment. When Bannon promoted white nationalism, misogyny, an accused child molester, severe online bullying and conspiracy theories, he was a king to the right-wing media, Trump and most of the Republicans in Congress. But when he dared to tell the truth, when confirmation from an insider could help save the country from the danger, Bannon was cut out like a member of Tony Soprano’s “family” who turned state’s evidence. It’s one thing for Trump to cut off ties to Bannon. But the wholesale embracing of Bannon’s political slaughter by conservative institutions for this, rather than for his past ugly sins, is quite another. Finally, dropped by the Mercers, and by extension and formally by Breitbart, Bannon is now a man without a country, friends or home. That conveys an ominous message: Do not criticize this American president or you will be destroyed. More: Trump's 'stable genius' reality check: America, this isn't a drill POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media It doesn’t matter who is the target, or that our disgust toward the likes of Bannon is appropriate and well-earned. The swiftness and robot-like precision with which Trump’s allies dislodged their lips from Bannon’s MAGA derriere, so they could effectively reach for their shivs upon orders from Trump, is chilling. Not one White House staffer has publicly questioned whether Bannon’s words rang true. Not one Republican senator has suggested publicly that perhaps we should pay heed to Bannon’s words to Wolff. No one at Breitbart, or the Mercers, or the Republican National Committee or even Bannon’s Gilligan to his Skipper, Corey Lewandowski, seems curious about what Bannon said — and if it’s true, what danger the country may be in. The only concern is to protect and cover for Trump at all costs. Even so, Bannon and others who “know too much” can be dangerous to a president with a few too many secrets. Trump would be wise to heed this advice: Never put anyone in a position where they’ve got nothing left to lose.

{"global_context": "Theresa May exits but the Brexit impasse will endure for the simple reason it makes no sense. So what, in Holmes’s formula, remains? What is the truth? A leadership contest will begin in May’s Conservative Party and the winner will become prime minister, with the task of resolving the Brexit debacle. Her most likely successor, given the extent of rabid pro-Brexit sentiment among Tories, is Boris Johnson, the unscrupulous, ramshackle, flip-flopping, dissembling former foreign secretary, whose uncertain relationship with the truth and unwavering narcissism resemble Donald Trump’s. “He’s got what it takes,” Trump, who will visit Britain early in June, has ominously proclaimed of Johnson. The adulation has been reciprocated. Both are men gifted in the dark arts. With Johnson as leader, the chances would increase of a so-called “Hard Brexit” — Britain crashing out of the European Union at the new deadline of Oct. 31 without any arrangement to govern its future relationship with its neighbors. But Johnson has many enemies; and that scenario of supply chains severed, trucks piled up at Dover and Calais, British residents in Europe cast into limbo, and sheer administrative chaos at every level of finance, trade, industry and small business could lead some Tories to defect and renew the parliamentary impasse or bring down a Johnson government.

But even as polls suggest many Britons have reconsidered their vote in 2016, and that a second referendum would reverse the result, the Conservative Party is being pushed relentlessly rightward by the jingoistic, right-wing faction that Johnson most vividly embodies.

The European Parliament elections, which will conclude Sunday, seems likely to deliver victory for Nigel Farage’s rightist Brexit Party (driven by people angry that the March 29 Brexit deadline was missed) and a stinging defeat for both mainstream parties, the Tories and Jeremy Corbyn’s feckless Labour Party.

{"global_context": "A federal judge on Tuesday night issued a nationwide injunction ordering the Trump administration to maintain the program. One of the lead plaintiffs in the case, Janet Napolitano, is currently the president of the sprawling University of California system of colleges but served as the secretary of homeland security for Mr. Obama in 2012 and was an architect of the DACA program. In his ruling, Judge Alsup questioned the administration’s contention that the DACA program had not been put into place legally. He asserted that the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security has long had the authority to grant the kind of temporary protections that formed the basis of the program. Judge Alsup also cited several of Mr. Trump’s Twitter posts that expressed support for the program. He noted that in September, the president wrote: “Does anybody really want to throw out good, educated and accomplished young people who have jobs, some serving in the military? Really!” Such tweets, the judge said, bolstered the idea that keeping the program going was in the public’s interest. The judge wrote that previous beneficiaries of DACA, known as Dreamers, must be allowed to renew their status in the program, though the government will not be required to accept new applications from immigrants who had not previously submitted one. The judge also said the administration could continue to prevent DACA recipients from returning to the United States if they leave the country. It is unclear what the legal effect could be from the judge’s ruling, but the Trump administration may be headed for more intense legal wrangling like the kind that happened after the president’s travel bans. A spokesman for the Justice Department, Devin O’Malley, said that the ruling did not change the department’s stance. “DACA was implemented unilaterally after Congress declined to extend these benefits to this same group of illegal aliens,” he said. “As such, it was an unlawful circumvention of Congress, and was susceptible to the same legal challenges that effectively ended DACA. The Department of Homeland Security therefore acted within its lawful authority in deciding to wind down DACA in an orderly manner. Promoting and enforcing the rule of law is vital to protecting a nation, its borders, and its citizens.” Photo The administration could quickly appeal the judge’s ruling, hoping that an appeals court would prevent the injunction from taking effect and allowing the shutdown of the DACA program as the president announced in September. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But such a ruling could itself be appealed all the way to the Supreme Court, potentially tying the fate of the DACA program in court action for days, weeks or longer. Either way, the ruling could have serious political effect. If the court’s order to restart the DACA program stands, that could take pressure off Republicans and Democrats to find a political solution for the young immigrants who could be deported if the program ends.

Almost immediately after the president rescinded the DACA program in September, Mr. Trump expressed sympathy for the young immigrants who were children when their parents brought them to the country illegally. Mr. Trump repeated his sympathies on Tuesday at the White House meeting. Democrats have seized on the president’s attitude, urging their Republican colleagues to support legislation that would permanently legalize the Dreamers to work in the United States, and give them an eventual path to American citizenship. But hard-line conservatives say that would amount to an amnesty program for lawbreakers, and some Republicans in Congress have been pressing for other immigration changes before they will support legislation for the Dreamers. In particular, Republicans at the White House meeting demanded an end to rules that allow immigrants to sponsor their extended family members — aunts, uncles, cousins — to enter the United States. And they want an end to a State Department visa lottery program that prioritizes legal immigration from certain countries in Africa and elsewhere. Democrats have warned that demands for those measures could undermine support from their party for legislation on the Dreamers, potentially threatening a budget deal necessary to keep the government open past this month. Xavier Becerra, the California attorney general and a former Democratic representative in Congress, filed one of the lawsuits seeking to block the administration from ending the DACA program. He hailed the judge’s ruling in a statement. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “Today’s ruling is a huge step in the right direction,” Mr. Becerra said. “We will fight at every turn for their rights and opportunities so they may continue to contribute to America.” But some advocates expressed concern that the legal efforts, while well intentioned, could undermine the push to earn permanent relief for the young immigrants. Camille Mackler, the director of immigration legal policy at the New York Immigration Coalition, said that while advocates were relieved that more DACA recipients would be able to renew their membership, they expected the government to appeal the judge’s ruling. In the meantime, she said, only legislation offering legal status to Dreamers would suffice to protect them. “This is not a win for us,” Ms. Mackler said. “We’re obviously glad that this is going to provide some relief, but what we really need is a clean Dream Act,” a reference to a bill that only legalizes the young immigrants without also imposing other immigration changes that Republicans are demanding.

{"global_context": "The president helped propagate the myth that a white genocide is unfolding on South African farms. South Africa’s government isn’t a huge fan of Donald Trump right now ― but to the country’s white supremacists and other extremist groups, the president of the United States is a “ray of hope.” Back in August, Trump parroted a conspiracy theory ― touted by neo-Nazis and Fox News host Tucker Carlson ― that problems with South Africa’s post-apartheid land reform and its murder rates amount to “white genocide.” Trump claimed at the time that the South African government was seizing land from white farmers and killing them on a “large scale.” That’s simply not true, as a new CNN investigation confirms. Though the notion of “white genocide” in South Africa has wormed its way into the conservative American mainstream, there’s no evidence to support the claim that farmers (let alone white farmers) are being killed at disproportionate rates to those of other groups of people, according to CNN’s report. There’s a murder problem in South Africa, but it’s not specific to white farmers, who own more than 70 percent of private farmland despite making up only 8.9 percent of the population. I have asked Secretary of State @SecPompeo to closely study the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers. “South African Government is now seizing land from white farmers.” @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 23, 2018 Trump’s August tweet was an immediate hit among American neo-Nazis and white supremacists. In South Africa, the president’s rhetoric had an even more significant effect. It signaled to that country’s extremists that their pushing of conspiracy theories was working so effectively that a world leader had signed on. Simon Roche, a South African white nationalist seen alongside neo-Nazis at the deadly rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last year, is the public face of his country’s white genocide hysteria. He’s a leader of the Suidlanders, an organized group of white supremacists who believe that a race war is coming. If any one person is the barometer for white supremacist anxiety in South Africa, it’s Roche, and he sees Trump as a champion of his movement. In Trump’s tweet, “we saw a ray of hope,” Roche told CNN. “Maybe there are people out there who know and care and have power and influence. Only time will tell how much is smoke and mirrors, shadows and dust.” As a groan-worthy bonus to that interview, Roche regurgitated Trump’s “very fine people on both sides” rhetoric when talking about far-right extremist groups in the U.S. and the Charlottesville rally. He referred to America’s fascists as “great guys.” “We toured for six months last year,” he said. “The thing that struck us was the classiness of the people who attended our talks. They are not your radical neo-Nazi kind of people. In venue after venue, in presentation after presentation, we met sterling young guys ― great guys ― magnificent manners.” With the wind of Trump’s bloviating in its sails, South African white victimhood is taking a world tour. Members of AfriForum, which bills itself as a minority civil rights group for white South Africans, have made trips to America and Australia to spout propaganda about ethnic cleansing.

The following post is sponsored by the Committee for Responsible Foreign Policy (CRFP). Scott Horton, author of a new book Fool’s Errand: Time to End the War in Afghanistan, argued that the ongoing war in Afghanistan is a “betrayal of American soldiers and Marines” at an event Tuesday in Washington, DC. “The hawks always hide behind the enlisted men with all of their arguments for any intervention and [say] the only way to support the troops is to support their policy,” he said. “That’s frankly just wrong, especially in the United States of America where it’s supposed to be a limited constitutional republic.” Horton spoke at an event hosted by the Committee for Responsible Foreign Policy, a non-partisan organization that advocates for a restrained foreign policy. He said when Americans join the military, they trust their leaders will only send them on missions that endanger their lives when it is absolutely necessary and to fight for the country’s freedom. “That’s what they are told they’re volunteering for – not to implement the grand strategy of some egghead at a think-tank who’s never been in a fight in his life, and who has a great plan for offensive war against people who’ve never attacked us,” he said. “And so, it’s just wrong that we’re not supposed to discuss this,” he said. “The foreign policy is a betrayal of American soldiers and Marines.” Horton said the “hard truth” was that America started the Global War on Terrorism when it supported the Afghan mujahideen during the ’70s and ’80s against the Russians. “America picked this fight,” he said, “to give the Soviets their own Vietnam.” He then walked through the history of U.S. intervention in the First Gulf War, Afghanistan, and the Second Gulf War, which he said fueled terrorists like Osama bin Laden who wanted to make the United States a target. “Al Qaeda’s strategy was to provoke an overreaction,” Horton said. Now, he said, years later and over $20 trillion in debt, the executive branch has turned into a “totalitarian bureaucracy.” “In comparison to the other branches of government, the executive branch, presidency, and the departments are virtually lawless,” he said. He also said they were in “open revolt” against the presidency for “good or ill,” citing President Trump’s desire to get out of Afghanistan and Syria, but being told by his advisers that he had to stay. He faulted former President Barack Obama for enabling the Saudi government in the war in Yemen. He said Obama supported Saudi Arabia in the war to assure them that, after the nuclear deal with their rival Iran, they would still be a close U.S. partner. “Americans have been helping pick targets, refueling, helping with intelligence, [the] U.S. Navy helps enforce the blockade attempting to starve the people in Yemen,” he said. “That’s the war we’re waging for the most spurious of reasons.” Horton is also managing director of the Libertarian Institute, editorial director of Antiwar.com, and host of Antiwar Radio on Pacifica, 90.7 FM KPFK in Los Angeles, and podcasts the Scott Horton Show. The Committee for Responsible Foreign Policy is a 501(c)(4) organization with the mission of pursuing a more restrained foreign policy that adheres to the Constitution.

BENGHAZI, Libya/GENEVA (Reuters) - Three people were killed on Thursday in a suspected hit-and-run attack by Islamic State militants on a town in southern Libya, residents and a military official said, the second such attack within days. Gunmen stormed the town of Ghadwa, opened fire before retreating back into the desert, residents said. The attack came after nine soldiers were killed on Saturday in an attack claimed by Islamic State on a training camp belonging to the eastern Libyan forces of commander Khalifa Haftar. Haftar has concentrated his forces in the northwest, where they have been embroiled for the past month in a battle for the capital Tripoli with fighters allied to the divided country’s internationally recognized government. Islamic State is active in the south to where it retreated after losing its stronghold in the central city of Sirte in December 2016. Separately, two boats carrying 214 migrants were intercepted by the Libyan coast guard late on Wednesday and taken back to the shore, the U.N. migration agency said. “As clashes continue in the capital, we are concerned about the return and arbitrary detention of migrants in #Libya,” the International Organization for Migration said in a tweet. IOM spokesman Joel Millman said the 107 people on the first boat included 12 women and 7 children, while the 107 people on the second boat were all men, 92 of them Sudanese, and there had been no reports of missing people or bodies retrieved. On Wednesday, the independent AlarmPhone website, which provides a hotline for boat people in distress, said it was in touch with a boat with about 150 people on board, who were using their clothes to plug a hole and panicking. The western Libyan coast is a major departure point for mainly African migrants fleeing conflict and poverty and trying to reach Italy across the Mediterranean Sea with the help of human traffickers. Smuggling activity had slowed when forces loyal to military commander Khalifa Haftar launched an offensive to take the capital Tripoli, home to Libya’s internationally recognized government.

Daley lobbed the criticisms as he unveiled an ethics plan Thursday that included a provision that he would not raise campaign funds during the first three years of his term, if elected. He contrasted the commitment against Preckwinkle, the Cook County Board president, and Mendoza, the state comptroller. Both politicians are on the Nov. 6 ballot for re-election to their current jobs. Preckwinkle, who also chairs the Cook County Democratic Party, simultaneously launched a campaign for mayor last month. Mendoza has not ruled out running for mayor but has said she’s focused on her comptroller race. Petitions aiming to get Mendoza’s name on the ballot, however, have been circulated for weeks.

This is crazy,” Daley said, seemingly ignoring the fact that Mendoza has yet to launch a campaign. “They’re doing it while they’re on the government dime and payroll. There is too much of this wasted time, spending time raising money between elections, and it’s just ridiculous.” Daley himself has raised plenty of money — $1.7 million so far to catapult him to the front of the field.

Daley singled Mendoza out for being coy about her mayoral intentions. Stacey Wescott/Chicago Tribune Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza has not ruled out a run for Chicago mayor.

She has told at least a dozen people I’ve talked to that she’s looking for money from that she’s running,” Daley said. “I’ve seen petitions on the street with her name, her address ... I don’t think that was done without her knowledge.” Pallasch did not respond to the allegation that Mendoza is behind the petitions being passed to get her on the ballot. Marty Castro, a prominent 2015 backer of Jesus “Chuy” Garcia’s mayoral campaign, has said he has been working to draft Mendoza to the race with “volunteers in wards across Chicago gathering signatures on behalf of” Mendoza. “The absurdity of two office holders, running for two jobs at the same time and basically raising and spending money for them, is like cheating the public and treating their sacred jobs as a joke,” Daley said. “It’s not like we don’t have problems in the state, the county or the city. C’mon. I’ve been around this business my whole life, OK? And the amount of time people spend on fundraising is ridiculous.

{"global_context": "\"I would like to apologize to Brett and his family for the terrible pain and suffering that you have been forced to endure,” the president told his new S... President Donald Trump took a prime-time victory lap on Monday night following the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, proudly proclaiming that the man had been “proven innocent” after a “campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception.” “On behalf of our nation, I would like to apologize to Brett and his family for the terrible pain and suffering that you have been forced to endure,” Trump, standing in the East Room of the White House, said in the televised event. “Those who step forward to serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation.” The event was the third swearing-in ceremony for the nominee after a historically contentious confirmation battle following several allegations against the judge. Christine Blasey Ford’s bombshell interview with The Washington Post and her emotional testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee threatened to upend the nomination after she accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were both in high school. The nomination went forward, and Kavanaugh was confirmed in a slim 50-48 vote on Saturday. Trump chastised the bitter process during his opening remarks Monday as every sitting member of the Supreme Court and several Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), looked on. He once again cast doubt on the women’s claims, calling them “lies,” following up on assertions he made earlier in the day when he told reporters at the White House that Kavanaugh was “caught up in a hoax that was set up by the Democrats.” “What happened to the Kavanaugh family violates every notion of fairness, decency and due process,” the president said in his remarks at the swearing in. “In our country, a man or a woman must always be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.” Trump continued: “And with that I must state that you, sir, under historic scrutiny, were proven innocent.” Kavanaugh himself sought to recast himself as an impartial, evenhanded judge devoted to the rule of law in his own remarks, a departure from his fiery testimony before lawmakers last week. “The Senate confirmation process was contentious and emotional,” he said. “That process is over. My focus now is to be the best justice I can be. I take this office with gratitude and no bitterness. My goal is to be a great justice for all Americans.” Kavanaugh also singled out several lawmakers for their work, including Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), whose last-minute support and blistering 45-minute speech on the Senate floor all but secured his confirmation. Despite the heated fight, the judge moved to distance himself from political divisions and said he planned to work with his new colleagues to be an “umpire, a neutral and impartial decider who favors no side.”.

After 15 years in politics, Rahul Gandhi is beginning to articulate a vision for India that some observers say is making him a more credible leader. But it's unclear whether Gandhi, who is president of the opposition Congress party, has rallied enough support in time to defeat Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Gandhi, 48, has often been the object of derision from political rivals, who accuse him, despite his pedigree, of being a lightweight. In contrast to Modi, a tea seller's son who went on to become India's leader, Gandhi inherited his power, making him an easy target of charges of nepotism and dynasty politics. For years, Modi and other leaders of his Bharatiya Janata Party have referred to Gandhi as the \"shehzada,\" or prince. Critics accuse him of being aloof, a cosmopolitan elite detached from the harsh realities of India's legions of rural poor. After Congress' hold in Parliament collapsed from 206 of 543 seats to a mere 44 seats in 2014 elections, Gandhi's political obituary was all but written. But with small businesses and farmers hurt by some of Modi's signature policies, and mob attacks on Muslims on the rise, Gandhi and the inclusive, secular politics the Congress party has long represented are starting to resonate. Gandhi is seeking re-election for a fourth consecutive time in the Uttar Pradesh town of Amethi. The general election, which is being held in seven phases, ends May 19, and vote counting begins on May 23. \"In finding his feet in politics, Gandhi has become a perfect foil for Modi,\" said political commentator Seema Mustafa. \"He comes through as humble, democratic and responsive, and plays on love, peace and humanity as against hate and aggression. The smile against the wagging finger, the embrace against the threat — it is all now part of a persona, natural and yet crafted.\" If Gandhi came across as a reluctant politician, the reasons are not hard to find. His family, starting with his great-grandfather, Jawahalal Nehru, has produced three prime ministers. Two of them, his grandmother Indira Gandhi and father, Rajiv Gandhi, were assassinated in office. \"In my life, I have seen my grandmother die, I have seen my father die, I have seen my grandmother go to jail, and I have actually been through a tremendous amount of a pain as a child,\" Gandhi said in a 2014 interview with an Indian TV channel. Even after becoming a lawmaker, he distanced himself from political life, refusing to even call himself a candidate for prime minister. In 2014, he was re-elected in Amethi, considered a Gandhi bastion, by only a thin margin. Yet, under relentless public scrutiny, Gandhi has honed his public speaking and leadership skills. He now comes across as more confident, forceful and credible, according to political analysts. And he is also starting to come across as a vigorous and even pugnacious campaigner. In Parliament, where he's represented Amethi since 2004, he had been a backbencher, leaving the party reins largely to his mother, Sonia Gandhi. But he's started to hit back. One recent barb in particular struck home — he taunted Modi for wearing a monogrammed suit worth $14,400, saying that Modi's \"suit-boot\" government was only for the rich. Perhaps most important, Gandhi has shown he has the stomach for a fight, even challenging Modi, a much more experienced politician, to a public debate. Modi has ignored the challenge. Gandhi's biggest political triumph in 15 years was easily Congress' win in assembly elections in December, wrangling power away from Modi's BJP in the states of Rajasthan, Madya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Suddenly, the BJPs' preferred Gandhi jibe — \"pappu,\" Hindi for greenhorn — began to fall flat. Suhsmita Dave, head of the Congress party's women's wing, said she has known Gandhi well for a decade and he's basically the same man. The only difference, she said, is that earlier, he held back out of respect for protocol, letting his mother run the party and Manmohan Singh lead the Congress-controlled government. \"He let them get on with their jobs. This gave the BJP a chance to paint him as a reluctant politician,\" Dave said. \"But the truth is that he was never a leader in a hurry. He waited his turn. When it came, he took the bull by the horns and has been vocal and aggressive. There is no point firing your gun until the time is right.\" Still, critics say there's a long way to go. Gandhi brought his sister, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, into the party, appointing her to oversee a post in the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh that includes Varanasi, the Hindu holy city where Modi is up for re-election as a member of Parliament. Her popularity has drawn huge crowds to campaign events, but it may not be enough to counter her brother's perceived sluggishness. Gandhi has been criticized for his low attendance in the last Parliament, showing up just over half the time; for being abroad at critical moments; for describing power as \"poison\"; for not cultivating a younger generation of Congress leaders; and for failing to fulfill a promise to overhaul his party's hierarchy. He also was unable to forge an alliance with two important opposition parties in vote-rich Uttar Pradesh to wrest power away from the BJP in the current election. In New Delhi, too, he was unable to tie up with the ruling party to combat the BJP. Whatever the result of the election, Gandhi is now seen as a feisty opponent, most recently in an interview with the daily Indian Express newspaper. \"That destruction of the idea of an invincible Mr. Modi, that destruction of the lie of Mr. Modi, is primarily the work of the Congress party,\" he said.

But the upper chamber is set for a nail-biting vote, with Republicans and Democrats still split on immigration. President Donald Trump has called off a trip to his Florida golf club this weekend until a deal can be struck. What is this bill? This would be the fourth short-term budget measure to squeeze through a gridlocked Congress since the fiscal year began in October. Federal agencies are funded through annual budget appropriations bills. But at the moment Capitol Hill is too engulfed by rancour over how the cash should be spent to agree a longer-term package. This current bill would only keep the government funded until 16 February - so the whole drama may be replayed in the coming weeks. Can it pass the Senate? Right now, no - the budget package doesn't have the 60 required votes. Republicans only have 51 seats in the 100-member chamber. But with hours to go until funding expires, there are a maximum of 47 Republicans in favour. Despite conservative pleas for unity so they can blame any shutdown on Democrats, three Republican senators are leaning 'no'. Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, says he is opposed because he wants more military spending and an immigration deal. Rand Paul, of Kentucky, is citing concerns about the federal debt. And Jeff Flake, of Arizona, said on Thursday night he was not \"inclined\" to vote for the short-term bill. He is backing a Democratic plan to approve enough federal funds for a few more days to allow both sides to negotiate a longer-term fix. So to get through, the bill would need a dozen Democrats, out of 49. But only one - Joe Manchin, of West Virginia - has so far said he will vote for it. The legislative brinkmanship looks likely to go right down to the wire. Image copyright Getty Images A sticking point has been the deportation threat hanging over more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants who entered the US as children What's the problem? The main bone of contention has been Democrats' demands for more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants who entered the US as children to be protected from deportation. These \"Dreamers\", as they are known, were granted temporary legal status under a programme established by former President Barack Obama. In September, Mr Trump announced he was ending the programme and allowing Congress until March to come up with a replacement. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption \"America is the only country I've known\" says this Dreamer The Republican president and congressional conservatives have been using the issue as a bargaining chip in an attempt to wring concessions from Democrats. Mr Trump wants funding for tough new border controls, including his proposed US-Mexico wall. Republicans have added to the bill a sweetener in the form of a six-year extension to a health insurance programme for children in lower-income families. They are essentially daring Democrats to vote against a measure that has been a longstanding liberal priority. But Democrats say they want this programme extended permanently. The legislative negotiations went up in flames last week after Mr Trump allegedly complained the US was letting in immigrants from certain \"shithole countries\". Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The missing - consequences of Trump's immigration crackdown What could be the political fallout? The blame game is already in full swing with neither party wishing to be held responsible for closing the government as midterm elections loom in November. This would be the first shutdown while one party is in control of both chambers of Congress and the White House, which could be politically embarrassing for Republicans. It's also problematic for 10 Democratic senators who are up for re-election this year in states won by Mr Trump. If they vote 'no', they will face voters this autumn amid a hail of attack ads claiming they shut down the US government to help illegal immigrants. In a late-night speech on the Senate floor, top Republican Mitch McConnell accused Democrats of trying to \"hold the entire country hostage\". Mindful of the risks, Democrats have shifted their messaging in recent days to say their opposition is about much more than just immigration. Democrats hope to make it instead about the president and Republicans' ability to govern. Tennessee Democrat Steve Cohen tweeted of Mr Trump: \"This man doesn't comprehend work ethic, the office of President, or duty to the country. He understands golf, ice cream, and Big Macs!\" What happens in a shutdown? Many government offices would be shut. It's estimated that about 800,000 out of 2.1 million civilian federal employees took a forced leave of absence during the 2013 shutdown, which lasted 16 days. But essential services would still run. That includes national security, post, air traffic control, inpatient medical services, emergency outpatient medicine, disaster assistance, prisons, taxation and electricity production. US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said that over 50% of his department will not go to work, and some maintenance, training and intelligence operations would come to a halt. \"We do a lot of intelligence operations around the world and they cost money, these obviously would stop,\" Mr Mattis said when asked about the impending shutdown, \"it's got a huge morale impact.\" National parks and monuments could face closure, which provoked an angry public reaction during the last shutdown. The Trump administration is reportedly making contingency plans to keep the parks running if no deal is reached. Visa and passport processing could also be delayed. More on Trump's first year.

JERUSALEM — White House adviser Jared Kushner on Thursday kicked off a renewed push by the Trump administration to restart Mideast peace talks amid signs of growing Palestinian impatience with a lack of progress so far. Kushner, who is President Donald Trump's son-in-law, was holding separate talks with the Israeli and Palestinian leaders, seeking to breathe life into a White House effort that appears to have gotten off to a slow start. That effort has been further complicated by domestic troubles for Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. After initially welcoming the election of Trump, the Palestinians have expressed increasing frustration with what they say is a failure by the U.S. president to offer a clear vision for peace. Specifically, they are seeking a halt in Israeli settlement construction on occupied lands, and an American commitment to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state as part of a peace deal with Israel.

Kushner was meeting with Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Thursday afternoon, before heading to the West Bank city of Ramallah to meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the evening. Kushner is expected to return to the U.S. on Friday. \"We have a lot of things to talk about, how to advance peace, stability and security in our region, prosperity too,\" Netanyahu said, standing next to Kushner. \"I think that all of them are within our reach.\" Kushner said Trump is \"very committed to achieving a solution here that will be able to bring prosperity and peace to all people in this area.\" Trump took office with hopes of forging what he calls the \"ultimate deal\" between Israelis and Palestinians. But he has since given few details on his vision for peace, managing to frustrate both sides. On the campaign trail, Trump took a staunchly pro-Israel line. He promised to relocate the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem — a move welcomed by Israel and opposed by the Palestinians — and refused to endorse the Palestinian goal of independence. His platform played down the significance of Israeli settlements and he surrounded himself with a group of advisers with deep ties to the settlement movement, including Kushner. Play Facebook Twitter Embed Assessing Kushner's role in the White House 7:35 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog But since taking office, Trump decided not to move the embassy and has urged Israel to restrain settlement construction. Still, he has not come out in support of the two-state solution, a position supported by most of the international community and also his Republican and Democratic predecessors. Disappointed Palestinian officials privately gripe that Trump's team has begun to support Israeli positions and ignore their concerns. Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki told the Voice of Palestine radio station on Thursday that the Palestinians would be seeking \"clear answers\" from Kushner on settlements and independence. \"Their answers to these questions will enable us to say if we have a historical chance for a peace process that can end the occupation or these visits are no more than a waste of time,\" Malki said. The atmosphere has been further complicated by troubles for all three leaders. Trump's administration has become preoccupied with a series of domestic crises, most recently the fallout from the deadly racially charged violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, earlier this month. Netanyahu, meanwhile, is facing a growing corruption investigation that could soon yield an indictment against him. These legal troubles, along with Israeli concerns about a possible long-term Iranian presence in neighboring Syria, make it unlikely that he will agree to any major diplomatic initiative. After years of on and off peace efforts that have yielded no progress, Abbas is deeply unpopular at home. He also is stuck in a bitter rivalry with the Islamic militant group Hamas, which seized the Gaza Strip from his forces a decade ago and is now pursuing a reconciliation deal with Mohammed Dahlan, a former Abbas ally who has turned into his political nemesis. These troubles will also weigh on Abbas if he is forced into making concessions to Israel.

{"global_context": "Conservative activists, GOP lawmakers and Trump tweets have amplified allegations that the Russia investigation is biased. Tom Fitton, president of the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, said “our concerns about Mueller are beginning to take hold.” (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post) For months, efforts to discredit special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign flickered at the fringes of political debate. Now, the allegation that FBI and Justice Department officials are part of a broad conspiracy against President Trump is suddenly center stage, amplified by conservative activists, GOP lawmakers, right-leaning media and the president himself. The clamor has become a sustained backdrop to the special counsel investigation, with congressional committees grilling a parade of law enforcement officials in recent days. “Until recently, it has been a lonely battle,” said Tom Fitton, whose conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch has helped drive the charges by unearthing internal Justice Department documents. “Our concerns about Mueller are beginning to take hold.” The partisan atmosphere is a sharp departure from the near-universal support that greeted Mueller’s selection as special counsel in May — and threatens to shadow his investigation’s eventual findings. Trump, while vowing to cooperate with the special counsel, has also encouraged attacks on Mueller’s credibility, tweeting that the investigation is “the greatest Witch Hunt in U.S. political history.” The controversy, percolating for months, escalated dramatically in early December with the revelation of text messages in which one of Mueller’s former top investigators, Peter Strzok, called Trump an “idiot” last year and predicted Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton would win the election in a landslide. Special counsel Robert S. Mueller departs the U.S. Capitol after a closed-door meeting with members of the Senate Judiciary Committee in June. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP) As the deputy head of counterintelligence at the FBI, Strzok played a critical role in both the Clinton email investigation last year and the Russia probe before he was removed by Mueller this summer. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who met with Fitton earlier this year and has for months alleged that the FBI was working against Trump’s election, said in an interview that many of his Republican colleagues now share his view that there has been an orchestrated effort against Trump. “I’ve had all kinds of Republicans come up to me and say, ‘This is unbelievable, it looks like the FBI was trying to put its finger on the scale here,’ ” Jordan said. [Trump team’s meeting with Mueller’s office poised to ratchet up tensions] Among current and former law enforcement officials, the public attacks on the FBI are seen as an indirect way of trying to discredit Mueller and blunt future findings he may issue, a view shared by many Democratic lawmakers. “There is a concerted push from the White House . . . and their allies to bring the investigations to a halt,” Rep. Adam B. Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in an interview. “They are also trying to attack Mueller’s credibility and the credibility of the FBI, so that whatever Mueller finds can be rejected . . . as a fake.” “The White House would like to have the best of both worlds,” he added. “They make the public case that they are cooperating, while their allies do the dirty work.” In response, Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer overseeing the response to the Russia investigation, said in a statement that “the President respects the Special Counsel and his process and will continue to fully cooperate with the Special Counsel.” A spokesman for Mueller declined to comment. Some of the key players in the campaign against the special counsel probe are veterans of politically charged investigations, having helped drive attacks against the Clintons in the 1990s and during last year’s presidential campaign. One leading critic is David Bossie, a former Trump deputy campaign manager. He was a congressional investigator who examined President Bill Clinton’s campaign finances in the late 1990s and currently leads Citizens United, a conservative advocacy group that produced movies critical of Hillary Clinton and other Democrats. Bossie now makes frequent appearances on Fox News and other conservative media outlets, arguing that the special counsel is being used to try to delegitimize Trump. He said it is crucial to make a sustained fight against the probe. “It is not that I wake up and say, ‘How do I match the Clinton playbook?’ ” Bossie said. “I just have the experience of understanding the rapid-response aspect of messaging. You have to be out there with a counter, set-the-facts-straight message or highlight what the problems are very quickly, or these things get away from you.” He argues there is no evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. “I’m not against Mueller; I’m against the concept of an investigation as a red herring,” he said. Fitton’s Judicial Watch group, too, has a long history of investigating the Clintons, having filed numerous lawsuits against the administration of President Bill Clinton. During the 2016 campaign, the organization obtained thousands of emails written by Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state. This year, Judicial Watch has helped stoke the attacks against the Mueller probe with material it obtained through lawsuits and Freedom of Information Act requests. The nonprofit group, which has a $35 million budget and 50 employees, does not release the names of its roughly 500,000 donors, Fitton said. Fitton has frequently gone on Fox News, conservative websites and Twitter to report his findings. On Dec. 2, after Fitton tweeted that Trump “needs to clean house at FBI/DOJ,” Trump retweeted another user’s summary of Fitton’s statement. In one email obtained through a Judicial Watch lawsuit, Andrew Weissmann, a senior lawyer working for Mueller, wrote in January that he was “so proud” of then-acting attorney general Sally Yates’s decision to defy Trump’s executive order banning travel by certain immigrants. The FOIA request was filed in May and was received in the fall, Fitton said. Other requests have taken longer or been rejected all together, he said. [Trump calls conduct at the FBI ‘disgraceful’ in latest criticism of bureau] Judicial Watch also obtained emails regarding FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe that the group says shows he was involved in helping his wife, Jill, run as a Democratic candidate for a state Senate seat in Virginia. McCabe was told in one email that then-Director James B. Comey had “no issue” with McCabe’s wife seeking the seat. Another document said Clinton attended a June 2015 fundraiser for Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s political action committee, which in turn gave nearly $500,000 to Jill McCabe for her state Senate bid. Republicans have also raised questions about the FBI’s handling of a dossier produced by Christopher Steele, a former British spy who was hired by a research firm called Fusion GPS to investigate Trump’s ties to Russia. Senate Intelligence Committee investigators on Thursday interviewed Bruce Ohr, a Justice Department official whose wife, Nellie, worked for Fusion GPS in 2016. In a recent court filing, Fusion GPS said it was being targeted by congressional committees “coordinating with the President [and] his personal lawyers . . . to misdirect attention to Fusion . . . due to their perceived role in exposing the ties between the Trump campaign and the Russians.” Jay Sekulow, one of Trump’s outside attorneys, has called for a second special counsel to be appointed to investigate the Fusion GPS matter. He said in an interview that his proposal “is in no way related to Robert Mueller,” with whom he said he has “a professional and cooperative relationship.” The pressure on Mueller’s team has increased as prosecutors unveiled charges this fall against four former Trump advisers. Less than two weeks after former national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, the Justice Department disclosed anti-Trump and pro-Clinton texts that Strzok exchanged with another senior FBI official, Lisa Page, while they were having an affair and overseeing sensitive political investigations of those candidates. The texts were uncovered in July by the Justice Department’s inspector general, which has been investigating FBI decision-making during the probe into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. When the IG warned Mueller in the summer about what the probe had found, Mueller immediately removed Strzok from his team. Strzok was reassigned to a job in the FBI’s human resources division. Page had also worked on the Mueller team, but left two weeks earlier for what officials said were unrelated reasons. The Post has reported that in a 2015 text, Strzok said that Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), who sought the Democratic nomination against Clinton, was “an idiot like Trump. Figure they cancel each other out.’’ In 2016 texts, Strzok wrote, “God, Hillary should win 100,000,000-0” and that he was “worried about what happens if [Clinton] is elected.” Former colleagues defended him, saying Strzok’s personal opinions had no impact on how he conducted investigations. “To think Pete could not do his job objectively shows no understanding of the organization,” said Michael Steinbach, former executive assistant director of the FBI’s National Security Branch, adding: “We have Democrats, we have Republicans, we have conservatives and liberals. . . . Having personal views doesn’t prevent us from independently following the facts.” But as news of Strzok’s text messages spread, Trump jumped on the story, tweeting: “Report: ‘ANTI-TRUMP FBI AGENT LED CLINTON EMAIL PROBE’ Now it all starts to make sense!” Republicans in Congress took the cue, seizing upon the texts to attack the credibility of the FBI and the Mueller investigation. “The senior levels of the FBI have been infected with an intractable bias that seemed to favor Hillary Clinton and work against President Donald Trump,” said Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida on Fox News on Wednesday, adding, “It’s time for Bob Mueller to put up or shut up: If there’s evidence of collusion, let’s see it.” The calls for Mueller’s ouster are strongest in the House, where a group of Republicans have been calling for the special counsel to resign. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan has said Mueller’s investigation should proceed without interference. But he has allowed several committee investigations that are calling into question the integrity of the probe. “The House has a constitutional obligation to exercise congressional oversight, and the speaker is supportive of our committee chairmen carrying out their work,” said Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong. In recent days, for example, three House committees grilled McCabe over his participation in the FBI’s Russia investigation and his role in the FBI examination into Clinton’s use of a private email server. Democrats called it a thinly veiled attempt to weaken McCabe and slow down Mueller’s probe. McCabe plans to retire in a few months when he becomes fully eligible for pension benefits, people familiar with the matter told The Post. “Those people should be investigating the real crime, which is Russia’s interference in our democracy, and instead they’re being hauled before a six-hour series of interviews,” said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.). At the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) and a small group of Republican lawmakers are discussing writing a report next year that would highlight alleged “corruption” at the FBI, according to people familiar with the plans. Such a report would focus on information about the conduct of FBI officials in the course of the Russia investigation, those people said. On the Senate side, one of the loudest voices has been Republican Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, who chairs the Judiciary Committee and has raised questions about the impartiality of Mueller’s probe. He has called for McCabe to be fired and shown a willingness to dig into Mueller’s past tenure as FBI director, complaining Thursday that the FBI and DOJ have been too slow to rout out people peddling “political influence.” Grassley has also called for a second special counsel to look at decisions the FBI and DOJ made at the time that the Obama administration approved a uranium deal giving Russia a significant stake in the U.S. market. The inquiry would bring de facto scrutiny on Mueller, who was FBI director at the time. Grassley said that his staff is in touch with Nunes’s staff, though he would not specify exactly what elements of their committees’ parallel inquiries they were communicating about. “I wouldn’t want to say there’s coordination,” Grassley said. “There’s communication.” He insisted that he was not aiming to discredit Mueller, adding that he has “got confidence [Mueller]’s going to be able to do what he’s doing.” Trump, meanwhile, has continued to urge on the questions. This month, he tweeted that after the FBI’s “phony and dishonest Clinton investigation (and more) . . . its reputation is in Tatters - worst in History! But fear not, we will bring it back to greatness.” Tom Hamburger and Alice Crites contributed to this report.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is working closely with allies to address issues relating to Iran, a government spokesman said on Wednesday, giving British backing to French President Emmanuel Macron’s talks with U.S. President Donald Trump. Macron said on Wednesday he spoke to Trump about a “new deal” in which the United States and Europe would tackle outstanding concerns about Iran beyond its nuclear program. “We are working closely with our allies on how to address the range of challenges Iran poses in the Middle East, including those issues that President Macron proposed a new deal might cover,” the spokesman said. The comments come as a deadline looms next month for Trump to decide on restoring U.S. economic sanctions on Tehran. He has criticized a 2015 agreement which effectively lifted some western sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program. However, Britain and its European allies France and Germany argue that the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is working and are seeking ways to address Trump’s concerns about Iran’s wider activity without ditching the nuclear deal. “The nuclear deal was a product of 13 years of tireless diplomacy and is working,” the spokesman said. “At the same time we recognize there are things that the deal does not cover but which we need to address including ballistic missiles, what happens when the deal expires and Iran’s destabilizing regional activity.” Under Macron’s proposal, the United States and Europe would agree to block any Iranian nuclear activity until 2025 and beyond, address Iran’s ballistic missile program and generate conditions for a political solution to contain Iran in Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Lebanon.

{"global_context": "The secretary of state, who may be forced out soon, presided over a historic gutting of the Foreign Service. But his replacement might be worse. Photo Rex Tillerson, who has clashed with President Trump and may be fired soon, has presided over the hollowing out of the State Department. The exodus of senior and rising Foreign Service officers will debilitate American diplomacy for a generation. It’s hard to imagine doing more damage to an institution and less good for America’s standing in the world in such a short period of time. Meanwhile, Mr. Tillerson’s sound instincts on the substance of foreign policy were routinely undermined by Mr. Trump and his incontinent Twitter feed. Mr. Tillerson’s obsession with downsizing our diplomacy has colored his time at the State Department. Instead of defending the department against the White House’s proposed 30 percent budget cut, he embraced it. Fortunately, Congress stopped — for now — the gutting of our diplomatic, democracy and development programs. Mr. Tillerson imposed a hiring freeze, canceled programs to diversify the department’s personnel, left empty dozens of the most senior positions requiring Senate confirmation and encouraged officers to leave by dangling $25,000 buyouts. Equally damaging, Mr. Tillerson’s insular management style alienated or marginalized many of the department’s most experienced hands. He and the small team around him seemed to view foreign policy professionals as the enemy — a “deep state” opposed to Mr. Trump’s agenda. In this they were profoundly wrong. Over the past 25 years, I’ve worked closely with hundreds of Foreign Service officers and civil servants through Democratic and Republican administrations. To a person, they take pride in checking their personal beliefs at the department’s door and working for the success of whatever administration they serve. I could not tell you the political affiliation of any of the officers with whom I served. But instead of looping them in, Mr. Tillerson’s seventh floor locked them out of policy deliberations. The result was to deny Mr. Tillerson the intellectual capital he needed to succeed when policy was debated around the White House Situation Room table. And the department found itself grievously short-handed of the assistant secretaries and ambassadors who actually implement policy around the world.

Last month, Barbara Stephenson, the head of the American Foreign Service Association, reported that “our leadership ranks are being depleted at a dizzying speed.” Since January, the department has lost 60 percent of its career ambassadors — the equivalent of four-star generals — more than 40 percent of its three-star-equivalent career ministers and about 14 percent of its two-star-equivalent minister counselors. “Were the U.S. military to face such a decapitation of its leadership ranks,” Ms. Stephenson noted in a message to her members, “I would expect a public outcry.” And the number of people applying to take the Foreign Service entrance exam has dropped by more than 50 percent.

(Photo: Drew Angerer, Getty Images) Here's one more thing taxpayers can start paying for: bulletproof vests for members of the U.S. House of Representatives. On a voice vote Tuesday, the Committee on House Administration passed a security resolution amending the Members' Congressional Handbook — read employee handbook — to make bulletproof vests a \"reimbursable expense.\" Under the changes to the handbook, members can hire security personnel for their district events, such as town halls, or to accompany them as they go about their official business. They also can pay for security guards to stand outside their district offices during business hours. More: How secure are our schools? Since Columbine they are locked tightly, research shows More: Congressional Republicans reject calls for tighter gun restrictions in wake of Florida shooting As for security improvements to members' home offices, such as building doorways or installing bulletproof glass, those are not reimbursable, but can be built into the monthly rent of the district office lease. The move comes eight months after House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., was shot and nearly killed at an Alexandria, Va., ballpark, while practicing for the Congressional Baseball Game last June. Three others were wounded in the attack, including two members of Scalise's Capitol Police security detail. When law enforcement can't stop someone, who posts about becoming a school shooter, and who is brought to the FBI’s attention, we have a serious breakdown. And if trained, armed guards assigned to protect a school fail to do their jobs, that’s a problem. https://t.co/2vCNVFyfeq — Rep.

{"global_context": "Republicans have increasingly claimed that the memo written by GOP staff members of the House Intelligence Committee, which was declassified by President Donald Trump on Friday, shows how the FBI conspired with Democrats to interfere in the election and even spy on the Trump campaign. \"#FISAMemo shows real collusion between Dem operatives & key officials at the FBI & DOJ to spy on the #Trump campaign & interfere in the 2016 election. The politicization of our intelligence & law enforcement agencies should concern every American,\" tweeted Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, on Friday. Other Republicans have used the memo to suggest the probe by special counsel Robert Mueller began with tainted fruit, so it is no longer needed. \"Finally, there needs to be a discussion as to whether the Mueller investigation is truly needed, seeing that the main premise that launched the investigation turned out to not be credible and was both directed and funded by political opponents,\" Rep. Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., said on Twitter on Friday. A Duncan spokesman noted the tweet was more fully explained by a statement issued by the congressman: \"The entire basis of the investigation into possible collusion with the Trump campaign and the Russians, along with the corresponding media coverage, was based on false information spread by political and ideological allies to Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama.\" The president has even claimed vindication: \"This memo totally vindicates 'Trump' in probe. But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because, after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING, collusion is dead). This is an American disgrace!\" Trump tweeted Saturday. But the actual memo does not back up these claims - and in fact undermines them. The facts Much of the GOP memo is about the FBI obtaining a secret court order to monitor a former Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page. The memo alleges that the FBI did not fully disclose to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court that some of the information stemmed from intelligence reports provided by Christopher Steele, a former British spy under contract for a research firm working on behalf of Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee. The FBI, in a rare unsigned statement, said it has \"grave concerns\" about the accuracy of the memo. Here's the problem with the claim that the memo shows that FBI was spying on the campaign: Carter Page was no longer associated with the campaign when the court order was approved. Here's the timeline. March 16, 2016: In an interview with The Washington Post editorial board, Trump names Page as one of his foreign-policy advisers: \"Well, I hadn't thought of doing it, but if you want I can give you some of the names. . . Walid Phares, who you probably know, PhD, adviser to the House of Representatives caucus, and counterterrorism expert; Carter Page, PhD; George Papadopoulos, he's an energy and oil consultant, excellent guy; the Honorable Joe Schmitz, [former] inspector general at the Department of Defense; [retired] Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg; and I have quite a few more. But that's a group of some of the people that we are dealing with. We have many other people in different aspects of what we do, but that's a representative group.\" July 7-8: Page attracts attention by traveling to Moscow and delivering a speech harshly critical of U.S. policy toward Russia. He emails campaign officials about \"incredible insights\" from his trip. Aug. 5: The Trump campaign begins to back away from Page when The Washington Post reports on the unease in both parties caused by Page's remarks in Russia. Asked to comment on Page's public statements and campaign role, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Page was an \"informal foreign policy adviser\" who \"does not speak for Mr. Trump or the campaign.\" Sept. 23: The Trump campaign denies Page was ever part of the campaign. \"Mr. Page is not an adviser and has made no contribution to the campaign,\" campaign spokesperson Jason Miller said. \"He's never been part of our campaign. Period.\" The statement comes as Yahoo News reports that a U.S. intelligence probe was trying to determine if Page had \"opened up private communications with senior Russian officials - including talks about the possible lifting of economic sanctions if the Republican nominee becomes president.\" Sept. 26: Page himself announces he is taking \"a leave of absence\" from the campaign, saying the reporting on his remarks has created a \"distraction.\" Oct. 21: Nearly a month after the Trump campaign says Page was never part of the campaign, FBI seeks and receives a FISA court order to begin surveillance on Page. The order is renewed at least three more times over the next year, meaning that the FBI is able to convince the judges that surveillance continues to provide assistance to investigators. The Wall Street Journal reported that all of the judges who approved the orders were appointed by Republicans. Feb. 16, 2017: Trump denies he ever met Page. \"I don't think I've ever met him,\" he told reporters at a news conference. \"And he actually said he was a very low-level member of, I think, a committee for a short period of time. I don't think I ever met him. Now, it's possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don't think I ever met him. I didn't talk to him, ever.\".

Left-wing California billionaire Tom Steyer stood outside Rep. Darrel Issa’s (R-CA) San Diego office on Tuesday to further his calls for President Donald Trump’s impeachment. Steyer also expressed his opposition to Issa’s support for the Trump’s efforts to repeal Obamacare and pass the Republican tax reform plan. advertisement Steyer reportedly joined several of the congressman’s frequent protesters. “We’re down here to say what he is voting for, advocating for, hurt his constituents,” Steyer, who supported Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama said, according to KPBS. “He is absolutely siding with the red state Republican rich people against the working people of California. It’s outrageous really.” Pro-Issa protesters were reportedly present, too, holding up signs opposing Gov. Jerry Brown’s recently-passed gas tax law, the largest gas tax increase in state history. Issa was reportedly in Washington D.C. during Steyer’s visit to his office. “What I know is, this president is a danger to the American people and I know the majority of Americans agree with me,” Steyer claimed. “I know that all those people in Washington D.C., whether they’re Republicans or Democrats, know he’s unfit for office.” Last week, Steyer spent $10 million to air a nationwide TV ad, including during the World Series, calling for President Trump’s impeachment and asking viewers to sign his online petition, which garnered over 1 million signatures in its first week.

{"global_context": "Florida lawmakers have approved a bill to implement a constitutional amendment restoring voting rights for most felons who’ve completed their sentences. TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Karen Leicht is a convicted felon from Miami and a self-described “cat lady” who wants to vote. Although Florida voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment to restore voting rights for most felons, she told a Senate committee Monday that she hasn’t registered because she wasn’t sure if she was eligible: She completed a 30-month prison sentence and three months’ probation for a conviction of insurance fraud she said she was unwittingly caught up in. “It was my complete and total understanding that at that point ... I was free. I now have a passport; I was able to travel to Italy to my son’s wedding this last year — so exciting! I’m like a citizen again, except for I still can’t vote,” she said. “I need to make sure that when I go and register to vote that I am not going to commit another crime, because I’m not going back inside. I was there once; I will not going back again. I work full time, I’m a caregiver for my mother, I’m a cat lady and I pay my restitution to this day every month.” That restitution totals $59 million. And that’s the problem. She’ll never pay it off. Her story is part of the debate lawmakers are wrestling with as they try to decide the definition of completing a felony sentence. The Senate Criminal Justice Committee approved a bill after hearing Leicht’s testimony that makes paying restitution a requirement to be able to register to vote. But even though Leicht will never pay back the ordered restitution, two senators — a Republican and a Democrat — told her to register to vote while lawmakers sort out the issues. The constitutional amendment says felons who complete their sentence and who didn’t commit murder of a felon sex crime can now vote. “Go register to vote,” said Democratic Sen. Jason Pizzo. “This is subject to interpretation; there is some confusion. You’re not intentionally committing a bad act.” He told her the state attorney in Miami has already said she won’t prosecute felons who register to vote if they do so believing they aren’t breaking the law. “Oh my God! I’m shaking! That’s so incredible! Thank you so much!” a clearly elated Leicht said. In a rarity in legislative meetings, many in the crowd burst into applause. Even Republican committee Chairman Sen. Keith Perry said she should register to vote, even though his interpretation of the amendment language is that she shouldn’t be allowed to do so. He called himself a supporter of felon voting rights restoration but said the language advocates put into the amendment means all court-ordered penalties, including financial obligations, need to be fulfilled. “If you need to go register to vote, go register to vote. I would encourage you to do that,” he said. “As a citizen, you didn’t swear an oath to uphold the constitution. I did, so I take it very seriously.” He added that he doesn’t want to put up roadblocks preventing registration and the bill could change going forward. After the meeting, Leicht cautiously said she would register based on what was said in the committee meeting. “If he didn’t say it on record, I’d still be afraid,” she said. “I do not want to reoffend.” Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

{"global_context": "Roy Moore, the Republican candidate for the vacant Senate seat left by Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions, has been accused of sexual misconduct with several teenagers. So far, he has stridently maintained that he will not withdraw from the race, leading to speculation about whether the Senate could refuse to seat him or expel him if he were to win the special election Dec. 12. Most constitutional law experts agree that under the Supreme Court decision Powell vs. McCormack, the Senate can’t refuse to seat Moore. There is much more uncertainty, however, over whether he could be expelled after he takes his seat. In 1967, the House excluded New York Rep. Adam Clayton Powell Jr. at the beginning of the 90th Congress because Powell had been accused of misappropriating public funds. He challenged the House’s decision, and the Supreme Court held that, because Powell met the Constitution’s age, residency and citizenship requirements, he had to be given his seat. If Moore wins the election, it is far from clear that the Senate could expel him even if two-thirds of the Senate voted to do so. The justices rejected the House argument that it had expelled Powell as allowed by the Constitution. Article I, Section 5 states that “each House [of Congress] may determine the Rules of its proceedings, punish its members for disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of two- thirds, expel a member.” Two-thirds of the House had voted against Powell, but because the congressman had never formally been seated, it didn’t count as expulsion. The justices further pointed out that the misconduct at issue occurred prior to the convening of the 90th Congress, and that the House's own manual of procedure at the time stated that “both Houses have distrusted their power to punish in such cases.” In the Senate, there have been 15 expulsions. During the Civil War, 14 senators were unseated for cooperating with the Confederacy. Another was expelled in 1797 for treason. These actions seem justified, even obvious. But how far does the power to expel extend? Imagine if one political party controlled two-thirds of the Senate or the House; could that party exclude a member solely for partisan reasons? The answer surely should be no. If the power to expel is limited under those circumstance, it is not hard to imagine other limitations as well. Take Roy Moore. As despicable a figure as he is (besides the allegations of sexual misconduct, he has twice had to leave judicial office for refusing to obey the law), if the people of Alabama want him in the Senate, is it fair to allow senators from other states to exclude him, and given the court’s comments in Powell, especially for conduct that he engaged in long ago? In the Powell decision, the court underlined its doubts about the reach of the expulsion power: A “fundamental principle of our representative democracy is, in Hamilton's words, ‘that the people should choose whom they please to govern them.’ … As Madison pointed out at the [Constitutional] Convention, this principle is undermined as much by limiting whom the people can select as by limiting the franchise itself.” Allowing the Senate to expel a sitting member for conduct prior to winning the election may appear to the court to also deny people the right to “choose whom they please to govern them.” Of course, other legal and political considerations could also come into play should this issue ever reach the court. Leading figures in the Republican Party, such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, have publicly said they think Moore should withdraw from the race. If he does not withdraw, and if he wins the election, it is far from clear that the Senate could expel him even if two-thirds of the Senate voted to do so. If the Senate leadership wants to avoid that legal fight, and it would be a protracted one, they should use all the pressure they can muster to convince Moore to withdraw. Otherwise, the people of Alabama may well get their way, for an entire six-year term or more. Eric J.

{"global_context": "The Trump he described was even more amoral than we could have imagined. Columnist In Michael Cohen’s historic testimony Wednesday, there was a moment when the long-lost spines of President Trump’s political enablers, probably heaped in a clattering pile somewhere, must have felt a chill. It was when Cohen looked at his Republican inquisitors and foretold their future. “I did the same thing you are doing now for 10 years,” Cohen said, sounding like an Old Testament prophet. “I protected Mr. Trump for 10 years. . . . And I can only warn [that] people that follow Mr. Trump, as I did blindly, are going to suffer the same consequences that I’m suffering. . . . Look at what’s happened to me. I had a wonderful life. I have a beautiful wife. I have two amazing children. I achieved financial success by the age of 39. I didn’t go to work for Mr. Trump because I had to. I went to work for him because I wanted to. And I have lost it all.” Cohen’s warning was ignored by those present. But his revelations advanced the inevitable day of reckoning — for Trump, his family and his party. Early in his opening statement before the House Oversight Committee, Cohen gave a description of Trump that will go down in the annals of congressional testimony: “He is a racist, he is a con man, and he is a cheat.” Incredibly, none of the Republicans on the panel even tried to refute the claim that the president of the United States is, in his essence, an unscrupulous grifter. One of them, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), did make a clueless and embarrassing attempt to defend Trump against the charge of racism. He brought out Lynne Patton — an African American friend of the Trump family who, with utterly no relevant qualifications or experience, was given a high-ranking job in the Department of Housing and Urban Development — as evidence that Trump is not a racist. Patton stood silently in the background, like an artifact on exhibit. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) was absolutely right to slam Meadows for using a black woman as “a prop.” For the record, it’s entirely possible to have a black friend and still be a racist. If you can’t or won’t understand that fact, you may be a racist yourself. But I digress. Another Republican made a weak attempt to challenge Cohen on one of his more sensational claims — that Trump never expected to win the presidency and instead saw his campaign as the “greatest infomercial in political history.” But there was no real effort to dispute Cohen’s many specific charges against Trump or even to question his shocking portrait of the man he once idolized. Instead, the GOP strategy was to follow the old courtroom adage: If the facts are against you, pound the law. If the law is against you, pound the facts. And if both are against you, pound the table. Oh, the table-pounding! Republicans found it outrageous that Cohen, whose admitted crimes include having once lied to Congress, was being allowed to sit there and testify, rather than, I don’t know, being dragged down to the basement and horsewhipped. How could anyone ever believe anything he had to say? Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) was so overwrought that I feared he might pull a muscle when he briefly thought he had caught Cohen in a lie on a boilerplate witness form. It turned out that Jordan was wrong — Cohen filled in the form correctly — and all the congressman injured was his pride. Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), the committee’s chairman, did a masterful job of presiding over the circus. He saved his best for last, ending the hearing with a closing statement that appealed to the better angels of our nature, wherever they might be hiding. “We’re better than this,” he thundered. And I so hope he’s right. But I fear there will be darkness before the dawn. Thanks largely to clever, substantive questioning by junior Democrats — New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez being perhaps the cleverest — there are new leads to follow. Cohen spoke of a whispered exchange between Trump and his son Donald Trump Jr. that suggests, but does not prove, that Trump colluded with the Russians. Cohen said the Trump Organization committed insurance fraud and was involved in other unspecified criminal activity. He gave the House Democratic majority ample reason to subpoena Trump’s income taxes. But the Trump he described was even more ruthless, selfish, amoral, dishonest and insecure — more unfit to be president — than we could have imagined. Getting him out of office is an urgent task for our democracy. We must be up to it. Read more from Eugene Robinson’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.

{"global_context": "The 2020 presidential candidate, a Navy veteran, said he served in order to protect the right for peaceful demonstrations. Democratic presidential contender Pete Buttigieg stuck up for NFL player protests during the national anthem, telling TMZ this week that his service in the military was partially about protected the right to protest peacefully. “The flag that was on my shoulder when I served represented, among other things, the right to free speech,” Buttigieg told the TMZ cameraman. “You don’t have to like it but one of the reasons we served was to defend that right, the right to peaceful protest and the idea that we can protest what is wrong with our country,” he said. He echoed his stance during an interview with The Washington Post’s Robert Costa. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, told Costa that in his view, the protesting players were “exercising a right that I had put my life on the line to defend.” “I didn’t think of the flag as something that itself as an image was sacred. I thought of it as something that was sacred because of what it represented,” he said. “One of the very things it represented is the freedom of speech, and that’s one of the reasons I served.” I was trained to stand & salute. But freedom--including to protest injustice--is the whole point of the anthem, the flag, and the country. — Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) September 24, 2017 Kaepernick inspired other players in the league to follow suit with similar protests during the ’16 season and into the 2017 season. Trump ― first as a White House candidate and then after he assumed the presidency ― frequently berated the protests. Kaepernick eventually opted out of his contract with the San Francisco 49ers and hasn’t played in the NFL since 2016. Trump, for his part. called on league officials to discipline players who continued the protests, insisting at one [pont that they shouldn’t be in the country. Buttigieg, in his comment to TMZ, said if Trump had served in the military, “maybe he would feel a little more strongly about those freedoms.” Trump was eligible for the military draft after graduating from college in the spring of 1968, a time when the U.S. was heavily engaged in the Vietnam War. But Trump received medical deferments that kept him out of the draft because he was diagnosed with bone spurs in his feet. A New York Times story late last year raised questions about whether that was a valid diagnosis.

{"global_context": "With the partial U.S. government shutdown dragging into its 26th day, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday urged President Donald Trump to reschedule his State of the Union address - a move that could deny the president the opportunity to use the pageantry of the speech to attack Democrats in their own chamber over the impasse. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With the partial U.S. government shutdown dragging into its 26th day, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday urged President Donald Trump to reschedule his State of the Union address - a move that could deny the president the opportunity to use the pageantry of the speech to attack Democrats in their own chamber over the impasse. With Trump’s address set for Jan. 29, Pelosi wrote him a letter citing security concerns because the Secret Service, which is required to provide security for the address, has not received funding during the dispute. The standoff was triggered by Trump’s demand for a round of funding for his promised wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Presidents traditionally deliver the address, which lays out the administration’s goals for the upcoming year, in the House of Representatives chamber before a joint session of Congress and the majority of the Cabinet. Democrats took control of the House after last November’s congressional elections. During the shutdown, Trump has routinely blamed them for the stalemate, although he had earlier said he would take responsibility. In comments to reporters on Wednesday, Pelosi suggested that if Trump would not agree to reschedule the speech until the government reopens, he could deliver it from the Oval Office instead, a setting that would lack the grandeur of a congressional address. The White House had no immediate comment on Pelosi’s request, and her letter appeared to take aides by surprise. It pointed out that she had invited Trump to make the State of the Union address at the Capitol but said the shutdown complicated the situation. “Sadly, given the security concerns and unless government re-opens this week, I suggest we work together to determine another suitable date after government has re-opened for this address or for you to consider delivering your State of the Union address in writing to the Congress,” Pelosi wrote. Representative Jim Jordan of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of conservative Republicans who are close allies of Trump, said Pelosi’s move showed the lengths to which Democrats will go to obstruct the president. “It sure sounds like she’s looking to not have the president come and give the State of the Union address, not have the commander in chief come and address the nation,” Jordan told Reuters. “I think that just shows that they’re more focused on stopping the president than they are on serving the country.” Meanwhile, both sides in the long-running conflict sought to ratcheted up the pressure. Democratic senators huddled on the outdoor steps leading to the Senate in 39-degree (3.9-degree Celsius), windy Washington weather, holding large photographs of constituents furloughed by the shutdown or otherwise affected by it. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump “is using these men and women as pawns. Using them in an extortion game saying, ‘I am going to hurt these people unless I get my way.’” At the same time, the president hosted a bipartisan group of House members to discuss finding a solution to the impasse. A placard is placed before Senate Democrats' news conference about government shutdown on the steps of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S., January 16, 2019. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas Afterward, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders called the meeting “constructive.” A handful of Republican senators, including Lindsey Graham and Lisa Murkowski, circulated a bipartisan draft letter to Trump asking him to support a measure that would reopen the government for three weeks while they work on funding legislation that would address his concerns about border security. A Democrat who signed the letter, Chris Coons, said the letter would not be sent unless a substantial amount of Republicans supported it. Trump on Wednesday is expected to sign legislation that would ensure 800,000 federal employees will receive back pay when the government reopens. Some government employees are being asked to return to work after being initially told to stay home during the shutdown, although they will not be paid on schedule. Both the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Aviation Administration on Tuesday said they would call back nearly 50,000 employees to handle tax returns, refunds and other tasks or to work in aviation safety inspection. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said it was recalling about 2,500 furloughed Farm Service Administration employees to assist farmers with existing loans and ensure the agency meets a deadline for providing tax documents. The Washington Post reported that Food and Drug Administration workers also have been called to work without pay during the shutdown. Slideshow (2 Images) The shutdown began on Dec. 22 after Trump insisted he would not sign legislation funding the idled government agencies unless it included more than $5 billion for the border wall. The wall was a signature campaign promise of his before the 2016 presidential election. Trump said at the time Mexico would pay for it but has since reversed himself, denying that he ever said Mexico would directly pay the bill.

{"global_context": "Two days after he taunted North Korea about his “nuclear button,” President Trump indicated Thursday he would postpone long-planned joint U.S. military exercises with South Korean forces to ease tensions on the Korean peninsula during the Winter Olympics. Trump told South Korean President Moon Jae-in in a phone conversation that he would agree to “de-conflict the Olympics and our military exercises” so both nations “focus on ensuring the security of the Games,” the White House said in a statement. The Olympics torch lighting ceremony is on Feb. 9 in the South Korean town of PyeongChang, about 60 miles south of the world’s most heavily armed border, and the Games will run until Feb. 25. Moon had requested the delay last month and Trump’s belated agreement came as Seoul and Pyongyang reestablished an emergency hotline on the border and moved to start bilateral talks there on Jan. 9, a nascent thaw that largely left the United States on the sidelines. The White House statement did not specifically say the annual exercises, called Foal Eagle, would be postponed. But a Pentagon spokesman said they were being pushed back until after the Olympics end, although he did not give a date. About 17,000 American and more than 300,000 South Korean troops participated in the 2017 exercises, which included drills to preemptively “detect, defend, disrupt and destroy” North Korean nuclear and missile facilities. North Korea views the annual exercises as pretext for an invasion from the South. The two heavily armed nations have had endured an uneasy peace since an armistice ended the Korean War in 1953. China, Russia and other world powers long have proposed a so-called freeze-for-a-freeze as the basis for reviving nuclear disarmament talks with the North. That would require the United States to suspend military exercises in South Korea in exchange for North Korea suspending further nuclear and ballistic missile tests. Successive U.S. administrations have strenuously rejected that linkage, saying U.S. military operations on the peninsula are defensive in nature, and thus legal under international law, while Pyongyang’s nuclear tests are in violation of multiple United Nations resolutions. On Wednesday, North and South Korea reopened a hot phone link at the truce village of Panmunjom, which sits on the border. Liaison officials from the two governments spoke for about 20 minutes, exchanging names and technical information, Seoul’s Unification Ministry said. While the United Nations hailed the apparent de-escalation, the White House has eyed the contact warily, worried it might be left out of talks in which Moon would offer overly generous concessions to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. On Tuesday, Trump responded to Kim’s claim that he had a “nuclear button” on his desk by tweeting back that his nuclear button “is much bigger and more powerful.” The tweet was so unusual that two Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sens. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Ron Wyden of Oregon, asked Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats to conduct a formal intelligence assessment of the risk it posed to U.S. interests and personnel. In a letter, the two said the assessment should include Trump’s “other threatening tweets and statements, and whether this rhetoric serves as a deterrent or a provocation.” Coats’ office did not immediately respond. On Thursday, however, Trump sought to claim credit for the potential North-South rapprochement by suggesting his tough talk had brought the two sides together. “With all of the failed ‘experts’ weighing in, does anybody really believe that talks and dialogue would be going on between North and South Korea right now if I wasn’t firm, strong and willing to commit our total ‘might’ against the North,” Trump tweeted. “Fools, but talks are a good thing!” The talks are likely to produce North Korean participation in the Olympics and a temporary period of eased tensions, but not necessarily a longer-term breakthrough, especially on the nuclear impasse, analysts said. Kim is likely to seek additional concessions, such as further delay in the joint military exercises and an easing of economic sanctions, but Washington is unlikely to agree, said Scott A. Snyder, a Korea expert at the non-partisan Council on Foreign Relations. “A temporary pause is welcome,” Snyder said. “South Korea would like lasting change in the trajectory, and will work hard for that, but it’s probably not possible” given the war of words between Trump and Kim. The developments began this week when Kim, in a New Year’s Day address, declared his nuclear arsenal capable of reaching all of the United States, and offered an olive branch to South Korea by suggesting he might send a delegation to the Olympics. Moon’s government quickly reciprocated, calling for high-level talks to discuss the Olympics and other “inter-Korean” issues. In their conversation Thursday, Trump assured Moon that the United States would send “a high-level delegation” to the Olympics, the White House said. Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., recently suggested that the United States might not participate if it thought American athletes would be in danger.

{"global_context": "Trump described Kanye West as a “very different kind of guy” and praised him as a “genius” who can help him usher in prison reform. Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. President Donald Trump on Thursday described Kanye West as a “very different kind of guy” and praised him as a “genius” who can help him usher in prison reform ahead of a planned White House lunch with the famous rapper later in the day. In a wide-ranging, 45-minute phone interview with Fox News' \"Fox & Friends,\" Trump said he had “a lot of African-American support” and that “a lot has developed over the last little while with Kanye coming out.” “I like him a lot, he’s a friend of mine,” Trump said of West, who is scheduled to meet Thursday with Trump, Jared Kushner and former NFL star Jim Brown at the White House to discuss prison reform, gang violence prevention and other topics. “He's a very different kind of a guy, I say that in a positive way,” Trump added. “Those in the music business say he’s a genius, and that’s okay with me.” West has repeatedly expressed support for the president, drawing backlash as a result. West has said that he didn't vote in 2016, but if he had, he would have voted for Trump, and he met with Trump during his presidential transition. And in May, Trump met with West's wife, Kim Kardashian West, about criminal sentencing reform. During the meeting, Kardashian West pushed Trump to commute the sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, a first-time offender who was sentenced to life in prison in 1996 for her involvement in a drug conspiracy. The president commuted her sentence in June. Trump said Thursday that he wanted to push broader prison reform and that if his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, was opposed to it, he would “get overruled by me because I make the decisions.” Trump has repeatedly criticized Sessions in recent months, and rumors have swirled that the beleaguered cabinet official will be fired after the November midterm elections. The Washington Post reported Wednesday that Trump talked recently with Sessions’s own chief of staff, Matthew Whitaker, about replacing Sessions as attorney general. In his interview Thursday with “Fox and Friends,” Trump praised Whitaker as a “great guy” but declined to talk about any “conversations that I had.” He said he was “not doing anything” when it came to Sessions and that “I want to get the elections over with\" and \"we'll see what happens.\" Trump touched on a multitude of other topics during the interview, including a response to comments made by his wife, first lady Melania Trump, that there were people working in the White House whom she didn’t trust. Melania Trump, in a previously taped interview with ABC’s “Good Morning America” that aired Thursday morning, replied, “yes,” when asked if her husband “had people that you didn't trust working for him.” “I let him know,” she said. “Some people, they don't work there anymore and it's very difficult sometimes because I'm so busy with my office, I don't get involved with the West Wing.” Melania Trump — who also said during the interview that she felt she was “the most bullied person in the world” — added that there were still people inside the White House that her husband can’t trust. Asked about his wife’s remarks, the president suggested such a situation was “more true” when he first moved to Washington. “I think it was more true,” he said. “I didn’t know people in Washington.” \"Now I know everybody,\" he continued, adding that, “I know some that I wish I didn't know but I know a lot of people.\".

{"global_context": "One of the most vocal defenders of globalization and talks with North Korea is sitting out the world’s biggest gathering devoted to them. Chinese President Xi Jinping is not expected to attend the United Nations General Assembly this week, where heads of state will contemplate issues key to the nation -- including how to respond to the reclusive state and the future of the Paris climate agreement. The absence is surprising for a leader who has pushed a more assertive, globally engaged China. Xi arrived at his first U.N. assembly in 2015 with a gift of 8,000 peacekeeping troops and a $1-billion pledge for peace and development. This time, Chinese officials said only that Wang Yi, the foreign minister, is leading a delegation. State media have barely mentioned the event. Russian President Vladimir Putin also is staying away, although a spokesman made it clear he’s opted to attend joint military exercises with Belarus. The answer to Xi’s nonappearance may lie with the country’s complex internal politics. The U.N. session comes a month before China’s twice-a-decade party congress. This year is especially important because it is expected to replace about half of the country’s top leadership and reveal the full extent of Xi’s influence. The Congress marks the halfway point of his term, and some analysts expect he will try to stay in power. There are indications that major party leadership spots \"are still up for grabs,” said Willy Lam, a leading China expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “So it’s imperative Xi Jinping stay in Beijing and not allow his enemies to pick up momentum when he's away.” Officials have worked to ward off drama ahead of the meetings, from clamping down on investment abroad to banning television shows during prime time that appear “too entertaining.” Xi's presence at the session could toss uncertainty into these final few weeks. That’s heightened by President Trump’s debut speech at the U.N. on Tuesday and tensions surrounding China’s role in stemming the nuclear ambitions of North Korea. “Beijing doesn’t want to be the target of multiple countries and multiple countries’ media pointing their fingers at China,” Lam said. Xi, in some regards, already had his moment. He addressed the U.N. European headquarters in Geneva in January and portrayed China as a global leader committed to climate change. On that same visit, he gave a robust defense of free trade at the World Economic Forum in Davos. And even if Xi is not physically present, his phone conversation on Monday with Trump signaled continued engagement. Foreign Minister Yi \"will give a full account of China's stances and propositions on the international landscape,\" ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said last week. He intends to work with other U.N. members, he added, to \"uphold world peace and stability.\".

Paul Markham died July 13 in Peabody, Mass., according to an obituary posted by the Gately Funeral Home. A funeral was held July 18, the 50th anniversary of the 1969 crash. He was 89. Markham was one of two people Kennedy confided in after driving his Oldsmobile sedan off a narrow bridge on the tiny island, which is located off the resort island of Martha’s Vineyard. Kennedy’s passenger, 28-year-old Mary Jo Kopechne, drowned in the crash and Kennedy was unable to pull her out of the water. Advertisement But instead of alerting authorities, Kennedy returned to a party he and Kopechne had attended and sought out Markham, who had recently resigned as U.S. attorney for Massachusetts. Markham and Kennedy’s cousin Joseph Gargan drove to the crash scene that night with the senator. Markham later testified that the two dove into the waters numerous times in an unsuccessful attempt to locate Kopechne, who’d been a campaign worker for Kennedy’s older brother, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, before his assassination in Los Angeles the previous year. Paul Markham, in file photo from 1969, the year of Sen. Ted Kennedy's car crash that killed passenger Mary Jo Kopechne. (Associated Press) Advertisement Gargan testified that he urged Kennedy to report the crash to police, but the senator didn’t. The following day, Markham went with Kennedy to provide a statement to police on Martha’s Vineyard. Kennedy pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident and received a suspended sentence of two months in jail. He was never indicted, but the incident mars his legacy. A graduate of Villanova University and the Boston University School of Law, Markham was appointed a federal prosecutor in 1964 by Robert F. Kennedy, who was the U.S. attorney general at the time. He became the U.S. attorney for Massachusetts in 1966 at the age of 36 after his predecessor, W. Arthur Garrity Jr., was tapped to become a federal judge. Markham resigned in 1969 after Republican President Nixon took office. He worked as a lawyer in private practice until retiring in 2004.

{"global_context": "He now plays down his role overhauling crime laws with segregationist senators in the ’80s and ’90s. That portrayal today is at odds with his actions and rhetoric back then. Mr. Biden apologized in January for portions of his anti-crime legislation, but he has largely tried to play down his involvement, saying in April that he “got stuck with” shepherding the bills because he was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. But an examination of his record — based on newly obtained documents and interviews with nearly two dozen longtime Biden contemporaries in Washington and Delaware — indicates that Mr. Biden’s current characterization of his role is in many ways at odds with his own actions and rhetoric. Mr. Biden arrived in the Senate in 1973 having forged close ties with black constituents but also with law enforcement, and bearing the grievances of the largely white electorate in Delaware. He courted one Southern segregationist senator, James O. Eastland of Mississippi, who helped him land spots on the committee and subcommittees dealing with criminal justice and prisons, and became a close friend and legislative partner of another, Strom Thurmond of South Carolina. While Mr. Biden has said in recent days that he and Mr. Eastland “didn’t agree on much of anything,” it is clear that on a number of important criminal justice issues, they did. As early as 1977, Mr. Biden, with Mr. Eastland’s support, pushed for mandatory minimum sentences that would limit judges’ discretion in sentencing. But perhaps even more consequential was Mr. Biden’s relationship with Mr. Thurmond, who became his co-author on a string of bills that effectively rewrote the nation’s criminal justice laws with an eye toward putting more criminals behind bars. In 1989, with the violent crime rate continuing to rise as it had since the 1970s, Mr. Biden lamented that the Republican president, George H. W. Bush, was not doing enough to put “violent thugs” in prison. In 1993, he warned of “predators on our streets.” And in a 1994 Senate floor speech, he likened himself to another Republican president: “Every time Richard Nixon, when he was running in 1972, would say, ‘Law and order,’ the Democratic match or response was, ‘Law and order with justice’ — whatever that meant. And I would say, ‘Lock the S.O.B.s up.’”.

{"global_context": "President Donald Trump is due to sign an executive order Thursday morning intended to allow individuals and small businesses to buy a long-disputed type of health insurance that skirts state regulations and Affordable Care Act protections. The White House and allies portray the president's move to expand access to \"association health plans\" as wielding administrative powers to accomplish what congressional Republicans have failed to achieve: tearing down the law's insurance marketplaces and letting some Americans buy skimpier coverage at lower prices. The order will be Trump's biggest step to carry out a broad but ill-defined directive his first night in office for agencies to lessen ACA regulations from the Obama administration. Critics, who include state insurance commissioners, most of the health-insurance industry and mainstream policy specialists, predict that a proliferation of such health plans will have damaging ripple effects: driving up costs for consumers with serious medical conditions and prompting more insurers to flee the law's marketplaces. Part of Trump's actions, they predict, will spark court challenges over their legality. According to numerous people familiar with the White House's anticipated order, the most far-reaching element will be instructing a trio of Cabinet departments to rewrite federal rules for association health plans - a type of insurance in which small businesses of a similar type band together through an association to negotiate health benefits. The order also is expected to expand the availability of short-term insurance policies, which offer limited benefits meant as a bridge for people between jobs or young adults no longer eligible for their parents' health plans. The Obama administration ruled that short-term insurance may not last for more than three months; Trump is planning to extend that to nearly a year. In addition, Trump's action is intended to widen employers' ability to use pretax dollars to help workers pay for any medical expenses, not just for health policies that meet ACA rules - another reversal of Obama policy. The executive order will fulfill a quest by conservative Republicans, especially in the House, who have unsuccessfully sought for more than two decades to expand the availability of association health plans, allowing them to be sold, unregulated, across state lines. As details of what the president is likely to sign spread in Washington in recent days, health policy experts in think tanks, academia and the health-care industry emphasized that the order's final language - and the ensuing fine print from agencies' rules - will determine whether the impact will be as sweeping or quick as Trump has boasted. \"It's going to cover a lot of territory and a lot of people, millions of people,\" the president said two weeks ago. On Tuesday, he added: \"It will be great, great health care for many, many people.\" In an interview Wednesday night with Sean Hannity of Fox News, he again predicted a big impact. \"People say 30 percent, some people say 25 percent and some people say it could be 50 percent,\" Trump told Hannity. \"It's going to cover a large percentage of the people that we're talking about.\" The action will come three weeks before the Nov. 1 start of the fifth open-enrollment season in ACA marketplaces for people who do not have access to affordable health benefits through a job. It is uncertain whether the departments - Health and Human Services, Treasury and Labor - will finalize rules carrying out the order in time for new insurance to be sold for 2018. Even so, with a shortened sign-up period and large cuts in federal funds for advertising and enrollment help already hobbling the marketplaces, \"if there's a lot of hoopla around new options that may be available soon, it could be one more thing that discourages enrollment,\" said Larry Levitt, Kaiser Family Foundation's senior vice president. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) is among the groups that have long opposed any expansion of coverage that bypasses state regulation. In congressional testimony in February, the NAIC said allowing health plans to be sold without requiring either state licenses or federal approval \"would result in less protections for the most vulnerable populations and the collapse of individual markets.\" Under the president's anticipated order, association health plans will be able to avoid many ACA rules, including the law's benefits requirements, limits on consumers' yearly and lifetime costs, and ban on charging more to customers who have been sick. Critics say that young and healthy people who use relatively little insurance would gravitate to those plans because of their lower price tags, while older and sicker customers would be concentrated in ACA marketplaces with spiking rates. \"It would be different pools under different rules,\" said one senior health policy source who spoke on the condition of anonymity since the order is not yet public. Currently, short-term health insurance makes up a tiny fraction of the policies sold, with fewer than 30 companies covering only about 160,000 people nationwide at the end of last year, according to NAIC data. Experts could not point to figures for how many association health plans exist or how many people they insure. Such arrangements have existed for decades, and scandals have on occasion exposed \"multi-employer welfare arrangements\" started by unscrupulous operators who took members' money and either did not have enough reserves to cover hospital bills or absconded with premiums. The National Federation of Independent Business, the small-business lobby, has pressed Congress to allow use of association plans, arguing that they can be less expensive and give workers more insurance choices. This year, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, pushed an amendment to unsuccessful ACA-repeal legislation that would have had a parallel effect, letting any insurer selling at least one policy that met the law's coverage rules also sell skimpier and cheaper plans. Selling health plans from state to state without separate licenses - the idea underlying much of the president's anticipated order - has long been a Republican mantra. It has gained little traction in practice, however.

A 26-year-old Utah man who has been imprisoned in Venezuela for nearly two years without trial posted videos to Facebook on Wednesday that show him begging for his life amid rioting at the prison. Josh Holt, who was arrested in the South American country with his newlywed wife Thamara (Thamy) Caleno in 2016, posted short videos and messages to the site, in which he claims rioters in Caracas are threatening to kill him. “Help me please united states, how long do I have to suffer unjustly in this place?” he wrote in one Facebook post. “I am not a political pawn i am a human being a child of God and I just want to live happy with my wife and children. I have NEVER done anything wrong in my life. Please help me!!” Facebook American Josh Holt, 26, posted videos to Facebook on Wednesday that appear to show him begging for his life amid riots at a Venezuelan prison. Rioting has been reported at the Caracas prison, El Helicoide, which is the headquarters of Sebin, the country’s intelligence agency. Videos viewed by Reuters purportedly show prisoners walking around freely inside of the facility demanding their freedom. “This has been taken over peacefully by all the political prisoners and all the prisoners who are abducted here, who are tortured daily,” one man is quoted as saying in a video. The man said tear gas and weapons had been fired upon the detainees but that they are holding out to demand their release. The violence reported this week in Caracas comes days before the country will hold a presidential election. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who is seeking reelection, has some of his top opponents imprisoned inside Helicoide. Utah Rep. Mia Love (R) said Wednesday that she has spoken with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and her office confirmed that the prison where Holt is being held was threatened by riots and violence but that he is safe. “I am extremely concerned about this situation, but have been assured that Josh is safe at this time,” Love said in a statement. “It is time for the State Department to quickly produce a plan of action in order to resolve this situation once and for all. Josh and his family have suffered far too long.” Holt was arrested shortly after his family said he traveled to Venezuela to marry Caleno, a fellow Mormon that he met online. It was while they were in Caleno’s apartment in a Caracas public housing project that they were arrested, with the police accusing him of stockpiling an assault weapon and grenades. His family has said that he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. His mother, Laurie Holt, speaking to the Deseret News Wednesday, said his trial was scheduled to start Tuesday but that he was never brought to the hearing. “He hasn’t had any justice whatsoever on trumped-up charges that are ridiculous,” she said. The U.S. Embassy in Venezuela tweeted Wednesday that the U.S. will hold the Venezuelan government responsible if anything happens to Holt or any of the other political prisoners.

President Trump's three-day visit to the United Kingdom will be greeted by throngs of protesters marching through London, many carrying expletive-laden placards and with an enormous “Trump baby” balloon flying overhead. Meanwhile, liberal media voices in the U.S. and U.K. assure their audiences that Brits are overwhelmingly united against Trump and his policies. But here in the north of England, particularly among those who supported Brexit -- Britain’s departure from the European Union -- opinions of Trump are far more nuanced, with many even offering strong support of the president. “If he came here, I’d shake his hand, absolute brilliant businessman,” Dean Roberts, running a market stall in Barnsley, told Fox News. “He’s going to upset a lot of people, that’s what we want, he’s a true leader.” 'If he came here, I’d shake his hand, absolute brilliant businessman.' - Barnsley resident Dean Roberts, on Trump Just as Trump, who arrived Thursday in London, won by breaking through the political divide bringing in Democratic voters with his tough talk on issues such as immigration and trade, a similar phenomenon occurred in the U.K. In many towns that traditionally vote for the left-wing Labour Party, voters overwhelmingly embraced Brexit -- an issue that had for years been pushed primarily by voices on the right. Barnsley, in South Yorkshire, is one such working-class town which overwhelmingly votes Labour. But, in 2016, 68 percent of voters voted for Britain to leave the E.U. Perhaps, then, it was not surprising to find a number of residents here with positive views of the president -- particularly his dislike for political correctness. BRITAIN AMBASSADOR DEFLATES HYPE OVER TRUMP BABY BALLOON, CALLS PROTEST 'IRRELEVANT' AND OUT OF TOUCH Amber Rose Roberts, Dean’s daughter and a model, was happy to have Trump in the country and had a message for the incoming billionaire. “Well done on being so strong and in a powerful role. You’ve upset some people, but you’ve also really got some of the community together and feel proud to be American,” she said, as they packed up the stall. Amid the negativity surrounding Trump’s visit, polling suggests support for the trip. A YouGov poll released Thursday shows 50 percent of Brits support a working visit, with only 37 percent suggesting it should be scrapped. That being said, 77 percent of those surveyed said they have an unfavorable view of Trump. As in the U.S., views toward the president vary by region. In Oldham, a working-class town just north of Manchester, many residents were hesitant to talk about issues to do with Brexit or Trump, particularly in earshot of other people. This was similar elsewhere in the country, where some who spoke with Fox News would glance over their shoulder before making a positive remark about Trump, while others would lower their voices when talking about issues to do with immigration. In these towns, there was almost unanimous frustration with the pace of Britain’s departure from the E.U. In London, Prime Minister Theresa May’s government spiraled into crisis after Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis both resigned after refusing to back May’s Brexit plan -- arguing it was too soft and would leave Britain still connected to the bloc. Some residents in these northern towns, while not always agreeing with Trump, said that they at least liked how he fought for his country and were drawn to his “America First” slogan. “He’s for America, and I think May should be for Britain but she isn’t,” Eugene Bibby, the owner of a domestic appliance repair shop in Oldham’s Tommyfield market, said. “Most of the guys I speak to around here agree with [Trump],” he said as he fixed a vacuum cleaner, and noted that immigration was one of those issues that resonated the most. “You’ve got to control it, haven’t you? You can’t just allow everyone in.” Kainat Usman, 17, said that she thought Trump was being treated unfairly down in London, even if she objected to many of his policies. TRUMP QUESTIONS MAY BREXIT PLAN “To be honest, despite how racist he can be, I don’t think I have anything bad to say about him because at the end of the day everyone’s different and he’s doing his job the way he thinks is best for him,” she said. “I don’t agree with everything he says, but everyone just pinpoints the bad things he does, they don’t look at the good side of him, because he’s not a bad person.” Others weren’t so sure about that assessment. “I tell you what I think, I think he’s a d--k,” said one woman who declined to be identified. Duncan Stewart, smoking outside a Barnsley pub, said he wasn’t a fan of Trump and was particularly concerned about the tariffs that Trump was slapping on aluminum and steel. “He wants everything, right, but he won’t give ‘owt back,” he said. “And I don’t agree with what he’s doing with Mexico, he wants to build that great big wall and make them pay for it.” Stewart also had little time for Theresa May and her approach to Brexit: “She sits there with a little f-----g grin on her face, but f--- all’s happening.” Trump briefly waded into the Brexit debate Thursday during a press conference in Brussels, before departing for London, suggesting the plan is not in line with what Brits voted for. “I would say Brexit is Brexit...the people voted to break it up,” Trump said. “So I would imagine ... that's what they'll do but maybe they're taking a bit of a different route. So I don’t know if that's what they voted for.” As for the planned London protests, he said residents in the U.K. “like me a lot and they agree with me on immigration. I think that’s why you had Brexit in the first place, because of immigration.” In Burnley, bordering Lancashire and West Yorkshire and where voters backed Brexit with 66 percent of the vote, residents Fox News spoke to on Wednesday appeared more interested in England’s World Cup soccer game that evening against Croatia than goings on in London. Market stall owner Simon Maxwell said he wasn’t particularly bothered about Trump’s visit either way. “I think it’s just the character he is that he seems to attract all this attention, I think deep down he might have some good policies and know what he’s doing, but it doesn’t come across that way, does it?” he said. “So he’s treated as a bit of a joke.” James Banister, proudly wearing a Burnley F.C. cap on a bench in town as he waited for his wife to finish shopping, said he was a lifelong Labour supporter who backed Brexit in 2016. He said Trump deserved to be greeted with respect, and pointed to Britain and America’s historic alliance as the reason why. “We owe President Trump courtesy to come into our country in the memory of all the thousands of thousands of people who fought in the two world wars on our side,” he said.

Despite pledges by both men that they share the same agenda, tensions between them have deepened since the Senate twice failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act. After the first defeat in July, Mr. Trump tweeted in August: “Can you believe that Mitch McConnell, who has screamed Repeal & Replace for 7 years, couldn’t get it done.” In another tweet in August, he said, “The only problem I have with Mitch McConnell is that, after hearing Repeal & Replace for 7 years, he failed!” Privately, Mr. Trump has repeatedly denigrated Mr. McConnell, most recently unloading on the Senate Republican leader during a dinner this month with a group of about a dozen conservative movement leaders in the Blue Room of the White House. According to two people with knowledge of the president’s remarks, he called Mr. McConnell “a weak leader” and said that he remained befuddled at Mr. McConnell’s inability to wrangle the votes needed to repeal the Affordable Care Act. For his part, Mr. McConnell has been deeply frustrated and rattled by Mr. Trump’s willingness to lash out, even as the Senate leader successfully guided the chamber to confirmation of Mr. Trump’s cabinet and judicial nominations, including the president’s choice of Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Soon after Mr. Trump took office, Mr. McConnell told associates that the new president had no clear sense of where he stood on most core issues, and he predicted that steering Mr. Trump in one direction or another — and taking the lead on policy — would be relatively easy. But Mr. McConnell and his aides have since watched Mr. Trump buck the Senate, both publicly and privately.

Mr. Trump has repeatedly hectored Mr. McConnell to scrap Senate rules that require most legislation to clear a 60-vote hurdle before final passage, a demand that the leader has resisted, in part, for fear of a return Democratic control. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. McConnell has also been taken aback by Mr. Bannon’s decision to start a political crusade against establishment Republicans in the Senate by recruiting candidates who could put at risk the party’s control. So far, Mr. Bannon has backed conservative challengers to Senators Jeff Flake of Arizona and Dean Heller of Nevada, and could formally back a challenger to Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi. Mr. McConnell said he was focused on keeping the Senate in Republican hands. “The way you do that is not complicated,” Mr. McConnell said. “You nominate people who can win. Our operating approach will be to support our incumbents.” Mr. Trump said that Mr. Bannon “has been a friend of mine for a long time” and said that his former strategist was doing “what he thinks is the right thing.” But with Mr. McConnell standing next to him, the president hinted that he would not entirely support Mr. Bannon’s efforts to throw out of office Republicans who Mr. Bannon does not think are sufficiently supportive of Mr. Trump’s agenda. “Some of the people he may be looking at, we will see if we can talk him out of that,” the president said. Advisers to Mr. McConnell said the two men talk more frequently than most people know, and that they have regular telephone conversations on the weekends, including one as recently as Saturday. The two men both recognize that Republicans’ fate in 2018 hinges on whether Congress can pass the tax cuts that Mr. Trump is seeking. “I feel like they are both under so much pressure to deliver — that’s what causes tension, real or imagined,” said Scott Jennings, a former adviser to Mr. McConnell who remains close to the majority leader. “They need to be able to jointly take something back to the voters next year to sell. I think winning on a major policy initiative like tax reform would allow for a further expansion of their relationship on politics.” That level of cooperation — which has been so vital to the success for past presidents — was in danger of completely unraveling before Monday’s lunch.

Ankara is battling to drive out the Kurdish YPG militia, which it sees as an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). President Emmanuel Macron met members of the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces, including the YPG. Mr Macron expressed hopes for dialogue between Turkey and the militia. His office said he had \"paid tribute to the sacrifices and the determining role\" of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in the fight against the Islamic State (IS) group.

Just a week ago, an IS sympathiser killed three people in a rampage in southern France, including a police officer who died after swapping places with a hostage. Why does France back the SDF? The SDF is a key US ally in the fight against IS and the Kurdish YPG forms a core part of it. France and the US have given the militia weapons and training to support its battle against IS. The US also backs the YPG's assertion that it has no direct organisational links to the PKK, which Turkey calls a terror group.

April 19, 2019, 9:14 AM GMT / Updated April 19, 2019, 9:31 AM GMT By Linda Givetash LONDON — A journalist was fatally shot while reporting on a riot in the Northern Irish city of Londonderry on Thursday, authorities said. Lyra McKee, 29, was described by one colleague as a \"rising star.\" Lyra McKee. Facebook Dozens of Molotov cocktails were thrown at officers during unrest in the Creggan area of the city, according to the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Around 100 people, including youths and members of the media, were at the scene when shots were fired before midnight local time. An eyewitness told the BBC that a gunman fired indiscriminately into a crowd. Leona O'Neill, a local journalist who was present, wrote on Twitter that she was with McKee when she was hit. She said McKee fell beside a police vehicle Land Rover and officers rushed her to hospital, where she died. Tributes praising McKee described her as a warm, wonderful person who was passionate about her profession. McKee had written for publications around the world including The Atlantic and she also edited for California-based news site Mediagazer. Her first book \"The Lost Boys\" was to be released next year, according to literary agency Janklow & Nesbit UK. She rose to prominence in 2014 with a blog post describing the struggle of growing up gay in Belfast, the capital of Northern Ireland. Mark Hamilton, the police force's assistant chief constable, said a murder investigation had been launched. \"We believe this to be a terrorist act. We believe it has been carried out by violent dissident republicans,\" he added. \"Our assessment at this time is that the New IRA are most likely to be the ones behind this.\" The New IRA is a small group of republicans who reject the 1998 Good Friday agreement that marked the Irish Republican Army's embrace of a political solution to the long-running violence known as \"The Troubles\" that claimed more than 3,700 lives. The riot was the latest violent incident in Londonderry this year. The detonation of a large car bomb outside a courthouse in January highlighted the threat still posed by militant groups opposed to a 1998 peace deal that largely ended three decades of violence in the British-run province. No one was injured in the blast. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi led a congressional delegation to the city earlier Thursday, as part of a trip to show support for the peace agreement politicians in Washington helped to broker.

{"global_context": "By MATTHEW PENNINGTON AND KEN THOMAS Associated Press WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump threw his weight behind the Olympics-inspired diplomatic opening with North Korea, telling South Korea’s leader Wednesday that the U.S. was open to talks with Kim Jong Un’s government under the right circumstances. A White House statement said Trump and South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in still underscored the importance of continuing the “maximum pressure” campaign against North Korea over its development of nuclear weapons — the U.S.-led barrage of international sanctions that is starting to bite the North’s meager economy. But South Korea’s presidential office also said Trump told Moon to let North Korea understand that there will be no military action of any kind while the two Koreas continue to hold dialogue, the Yonhap news agency reported. On Tuesday, the two Koreas held their first talks in two years and agreed on the North’s participation in the Winter Olympics being held the South next month. The prospects of resolving decades-old tensions on the divided Korean Peninsula remain deeply uncertain. North Korea has shown no willingness to discuss its nuclear weapons which pose an emerging threat to the American mainland, and it has stuck to its tough stance toward Washington while it tries to woo the South. The newspaper of the ruling party on Tuesday called Trump a “lunatic” and said the U.S. needs to accept North Korea is now a nuclear power. But the thaw between North and South, which have also restored a military hotline, provides a diplomatic opening after months of escalating tensions that have fueled fears of war. “President Trump expressed his openness to holding talks between the United States and North Korea at the appropriate time, under the right circumstances,” the White House statement said. Trump also told Moon that Vice President Mike Pence and his wife Karen Pence will lead the U.S. delegation to the Winter Olympics, scheduled for Feb. 9-25 in Pyeongchang. Pence will stop in Alaska to review intercontinental ballistic missile defense systems and in Japan, stressing the U.S. commitment to stability in the region. Speaking at Cabinet meeting Wednesday, Trump claimed his administration’s pressure campaign had prompted the North Koreans to negotiate with the South, and he voiced cautious hopes for diplomatic success. “Without our attitude that would have never happened,” Trump said of the inter-Korean dialogue. “Who knows where it leads. Hopefully it will lead to success for the world — not just for our country but for the world, and we’ll be seeing over the next number of weeks and months what happens.” Moon has been supportive of the pressure campaign but has long advocated engagement with Pyongyang. He told reporters in Seoul Wednesday that he’s open to meeting with Kim to resolve the North Korean nuclear standoff, although he said the success of such a summit must be guaranteed before the meeting can be realized. Trump has previously scoffed at the futility of talking with the North, but when the inter-Korean dialogue was proposed last week he claimed credit and declared in a tweet, “talks are a good thing.” The White House said Moon had briefed Trump on the outcomes of the North-South talks on Tuesday, and “thanked President Trump for his influential leadership in making the talks possible.” Yonhap cited Moon’s chief press secretary, Yoon Young-chan, as saying Trump dismissed a recent report that he may be considering military action against the North. The White House statement did not mention that, nor Trump’s assurance that military force would not happen while the two Koreas continue to talk. The U.S. retains 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War that ended with an armistice rather than a peace treaty, leaving the adversaries in a state of war for the past six decades. The prospect of military confrontation has been magnified in the past year as Trump and Kim have traded bellicose rhetoric and crude insults, as the North has conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear detonation and three tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles that now put the U.S. mainland in North Korea’s range. Resorting to force is widely viewed as very risky. A pre-emptive U.S. attack could provoke a devastating retaliation by North Korea against the South, whose capital Seoul lies with the range of North Korean artillery and rockets.

Glenn Simpson – the co-founder of the Fusion GPS research group that commissioned the unverified, Democrat-funded anti-Trump dossier – on Tuesday invoked his Fifth Amendment right not to testify during an appearance before the House Judiciary Committee. On Capitol Hill, Simpson declined to answer multiple shouted questions from Fox News about his refusal to testify as he arrived to the committee room. Late Monday, Simpson’s lawyer, Joshua Levy, took aim at Republican lawmakers for compelling him to appear. \"Compelling Glenn Simpson to appear for a confidential deposition after he has stated his intention to invoke his constitutional right not to testify reflects the worst practices of past congressional investigations and reinforces that this is a political exercise, not a serious inquiry,\" Levy said in a statement. The dossier, authored by former British spy Christopher Steele and commissioned by Fusion GPS, was paid for by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign through law firm Perkins Coie. It included salacious and unverified allegations about Trump's visit to Russia before he was president and has become a central focus as lawmakers investigate the origins of the Russia investigation. Simpson’s refusal to testify comes as other key figures connected to the dossier have been called to testify on Capitol Hill this week, as the House investigation into Justice Department actions during the 2016 campaign comes to a head. A deposition is also scheduled for Thursday with James A. Baker, the FBI’s former top lawyer. Baker, who had a close working relationship with former FBI Director James Comey, left the bureau earlier this year. Earlier this month, Baker testified about the genesis of the bureau’s Russia investigation, sources close to a congressional investigation told Fox News. He also testified that Perkins Coie lawyer Michael Sussmann gave him documents pertaining to the Russia probe, suggesting another connection between the early stages of the FBI’s Russia probe and those working with the DNC and the Clinton campaign, the sources said. House Republicans have also scheduled a deposition for Friday with Nellie Ohr, a Russia researcher for Simpson’s company. Ohr is married to Bruce Ohr, a Justice Department official who has also testified about his contact with Simpson during the campaign. “Is it really possible that Bruce Ohr, whose wife Nellie was paid by Simpson and GPS Fusion for work done on the Fake Dossier, and who was used as a Pawn in this whole SCAM (WITCH HUNT), is still working for the Department of Justice????? Can this really be so?????” President Trump tweeted Tuesday. Baker and Ohr are appearing for voluntary depositions, which take place as transcribed interviews under oath. The dossier, which has been at the center of an intense power struggle between congressional Republicans and the FBI, specifically cites the DOJ and FBI’s surveillance of Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, saying the dossier \"formed an essential part\" of the application to spy on him. Fox News learned Monday that Page has filed suit in Oklahoma against the DNC, as well as the law firm Perkins Coie, and its principals Marc Elias and Sussman over the dossier, and what Page claims were “slanderous” and “libelous” statements. \"It goes beyond any damages or any financial aspect,\" Page told Fox News' \"Hannity\" Monday night. \"There have been so many lies.

{"global_context": "Republicans have accused Peter Strzok, who previously worked on special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, of being anti-Trump. WASHINGTON ― FBI agent Peter Strzok helped draft a letter that, in the final days of the 2016 presidential campaign, signaled the re-opening of a probe into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s emails, CNN reported Wednesday. Strzok is one of the FBI agents whom some Republicans have accused of scheming to undermine President Donald Trump ahead of the 2016 election. He worked on both the Clinton probe as well as the Russia probe when it was in its early stages, and later joined special counsel Robert Mueller’s team. The letter Strzok helped draft, sent to Congress by then-FBI Director James Comey on Oct. 28 ― days ahead of the 2016 election ― dealt a blow to Clinton, whom Trump repeatedly attacked for using a personal email while serving as secretary of state. Comey penned another letter just before the election saying no new relevant information was found, and stood by the FBI’s prior decision not to recommend charges The FBI’s actions ahead of the 2016 campaign hurt Clinton, while the bureau stayed quiet about its ongoing probe into ties between Trump associates and Russia. Nevertheless, many Republicans have been working off of the idea that the FBI’s actions somehow hurt Trump’s election, and say the FBI continued to work behind the scenes to undermine his presidency. Republicans have seized upon text messages between Strzok and an FBI attorney with whom he had a relationship, Lisa Page. Neither were fans of Trump, but they also exchanged texts venting about Democratic politicians and figures as well. One particular text ― a joke about a “secret society” sent hours after Trump’s election ― drew lots of attention from Republicans, who painted it as evidence of a vast conspiracy within the bureau. As it turned out, the joke was made in connection with gag gift calendars Strzok had bought for the team working on the Russia probe that featured “beefcake” photos of Russian President Vladimir Putin. CNN reported that Strzok did have reservations about Comey making the announcement public, and text messages showed they were troubled by the fallout from the letter. “Christ. It’s there led on freaking MARKETPLACE,” Page texted, an apparent reference to the NPR show. “Our statement affected the stock market. 😡” FBI texts Republican theories about the actions of the two FBI employees haven’t really panned out, as HuffPost has reported. Republicans suggested that they were leaking anti-Trump information to the media, when in reality, Page cooperated with a story in which she defended the bureau’s handling of the Clinton probe. Another set of texts indicated they rejected an outsider’s suggestion that the FBI should have gone after agents leaking information about the Clinton investigation by monitoring an ex-FBI official’s phone.

{"global_context": "A former top aide to Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan broke his silence Wednesday about sexual harassment allegations against him, echoing a legal defense already laid by the speaker’s camp and attacking the political worker who made the charges. Ex-Madigan lieutenant Kevin Quinn, who was fired in February as Democratic foot soldier Alaina Hampton was about to go public, downplayed suggestions that the speaker’s political army retaliated against her after she complained about unwanted advances as well as aggressive text messages and phone calls from Quinn. In a 14-page annotated statement he dubbed “The Truth,” Quinn acknowledged his behavior was inappropriate but said it did not rise to the legal level of workplace harassment. Quinn also portrayed Hampton as an unreliable employee who was on bad terms with the speaker’s political organization after twice leaving jobs connected to Madigan. The final straw, Quinn said, was when Hampton went to work on Marie Newman’s congressional campaign last year even though Madigan backed U.S. Rep. Dan Lipinski. “Alaina wanted to be a member of the Organization on her own terms. She was never retaliated against in any way,” Quinn wrote. “She was treated the same as any other volunteer would have been treated that quit both speaker’s government staff in 2014 and the 13th Ward Democratic Organization in 2016 by not being welcomed back for additional political assignments.” Hampton is suing the state Democratic Party and three Madigan-controlled campaign funds. She maintains she attempted to work for a House Democratic campaign this year but was rebuffed, a move that she said stymied her career. On Wednesday, Hampton deferred comment to her lawyer, who was in court for a routine hearing on the lawsuit. Attorney Shelly Kulwin said he couldn’t respond in detail because there is information his side doesn’t have, such as possible communications with Madigan. “What was happening that we haven’t seen yet?” Kulwin said. “I’ll respond to ‘the truth’ once I know.” Quinn’s statement, however, drew sharp criticism from Democratic Rep. Kelly Cassidy of Chicago, who has been a vocal critic of Madigan’s handling of sexual harassment allegations. She said Quinn’s memo could deter other women from coming forward with sexual harassment complaints. “This is just another offensive tactic from the old playbook that aims to discredit and undermine women who come forward,” Cassidy said. “Women considering speaking out should not let Mr. Quinn’s despicable behavior deter them.” Quinn’s statement — in which he often refers to himself in the third person — includes several partial transcripts of news conference quotes involving Hampton, a timeline and an appendix. Much of the document is devoted to absolving Madigan and Quinn’s brother, 13th Ward Ald. Marty Quinn. Alaina Hampton formerly worked on political campaigns for the Democratic organization run by Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan. Hampton says her supervisor, Kevin Quinn, sexually harassed her for several months beginning in fall 2016. (Stacey Wescott / Chicago Tribune) Alaina Hampton formerly worked on political campaigns for the Democratic organization run by Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan. Hampton says her supervisor, Kevin Quinn, sexually harassed her for several months beginning in fall 2016. (Stacey Wescott / Chicago Tribune) SEE MORE VIDEOS Kevin Quinn, who has been unemployed since February, told the Tribune on Wednesday that he spent “a long time” working on the statement and did not share it with Madigan’s camp before sending it to reporters. Madigan spokesman Steve Brown said that “to our knowledge, no one within the speaker’s government or political offices had any involvement with Kevin Quinn in preparing this document.” The former political worker’s memo put the sexual harassment story back in the spotlight a week after Madigan ousted his longtime chief of staff following sexual harassment and bullying allegations from a House staff member against the speaker’s top aide. Tim Mapes’ departure marked the fourth time in four months that Madigan quickly distanced himself from a key operative after public allegations of improper behavior. As the #MeToo movement continues to have repercussions at the Illinois Capitol, some Democratic women lawmakers have suggested that Madigan has failed to act aggressively enough to address complaints of harassment lodged against the well-connected men within his political organization. Earlier this week, Madigan announced that he would hire a human resources director as well as an equal employment opportunity and affirmative action officer for the House Democrats. On Feb. 12, as Hampton prepared to take legal action, Madigan issued a news release stating that Kevin Quinn had been forced out of the political organization, calling Hampton “courageous” and acknowledging Quinn’s inappropriate behavior. The release also came less than 24 hours after Hampton met with a Tribune reporter and provided explicit texts that Quinn sent her, including one in which he referenced a Facebook picture of Hampton in a bikini and called her “smoking hot.” Hampton repeatedly discouraged the overtures, saying she wanted to keep the relationship professional. Both sides agree the unwanted contact stopped after Ald. Quinn reprimanded his brother. Quinn attempted to dissect several of those text messages in his statement, using select phrases from them to prove he wasn’t Hampton’s supervisor — a key defense offered by Madigan’s attorneys in the wake of the scandal. Hampton’s direct supervisor was Ald. Quinn, the memo contends. “I was never Ms. Hampton’s supervisor and never had any control over her assignments. My role was to simply facilitate communication between Alderman Marty Quinn, managers of targeted campaigns, and volunteers of the 13th Ward Democratic Organization,” he said.

{"global_context": "The New York state tax department is reviewing claims made in a New York Times article that Donald Trump used dubious tax schemes and possible fraud in the 1990s. Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. The New York State Department of Taxation and Finance says it is reviewing allegations made in a New York Times article about questionable tax schemes used by now-President Donald Trump in the 1990s. The New York Times published an investigation on Tuesday that said Trump participated in dubious tax schemes, including instances of fraud, to increase the fortune left to him by his parents. NBC News has not confirmed the allegations in the report, which the Times said was the result of a lengthy investigation into the Trump family's finances. \"The tax department is reviewing the allegations in the NYT article and is vigorously pursuing all appropriate avenues of investigation,\" James Gazzale, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, said in an email to NBC News. A lawyer for Trump, Charles Harder, in a statement said \"The New York Times’ allegations of fraud and tax evasion are 100% false, and highly defamatory\" and that \"There was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone.\" He said \"the facts upon which the Times bases its false allegations are extremely inaccurate.\" White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders also disputed the article, and called the report a “misleading attack against the Trump family.\" The Times reported that Trump received the equivalent of $413 million in today’s dollars from the real estate empire of his father, Fred Trump, and the Times reported that “much of this money came to Mr. Trump because he helped his parents dodge taxes.” New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, tweeted Tuesday night: \"I’ve directed NYC’s Department of Finance to immediately investigate tax and housing violations and to work with NY State to find out if appropriate taxes were paid.\" Trump refused to the release his tax returns in the run up to the 2016 presidential election or after being elected, breaking with tradition. Sanders on Tuesday said about the Times’ report that \"Many decades ago the IRS reviewed and signed off on these transactions\" and accused the Times and other media outlets of being \"consumed with attacking the president and his family 24/7 instead of reporting the news.\" Trump on Twitter Wednesday attacked \"The Failing New York Times,\" and called the investigation \"a very old, boring and often told hit piece on me.\".

{"global_context": "If Trump is a Carter figure, there’s an obvious candidate to play the Gipper. Of course the analogy is imperfect — don’t come at me with Bernie never governed a major state and Reagan was a New Deal Democrat and had a whole celebrity career before he went into politics, I’m well aware. But it’s an interesting echo, at the very least. And the parallels between the arguments used to dismiss Sanders and the Reagan-can’t-win assumptions of late-1970s pundits have kept me moderately bullish on the Vermont socialist’s 2020 chances. With Sanders officially in the race, the reasons for bullishness have grown. Whether he is technically the front-runner or not depends on how you assess the impressive poll numbers of the undeclared Joe Biden: Are those a real signifier that the Democratic Party’s moderate wing is ready to have the former vice president as its champion, or just an artifact of name recognition that will collapse once Biden starts having to answer for his record? But every normal metric makes Sanders a front-runner, and a stronger-looking candidate than all his declared rivals: His fund-raising is impressive, his crowds are big, and his early poll numbers give him both the expected 20-25 percent floor and room to grow. (In the weekend’s poll of Iowa, he would claim almost a third of Biden’s supporters if the ex-vice president decided not to run.) And he’s facing a field sufficiently large that the advantages of having a core of unshakable supporters are likely to be magnified. Meanwhile his campaign so far is suggestive of the ways — again, like Reagan — that a long history of ideological extremism can actually be helpful to a presidential candidate. Precisely because Sanders is a known quantity, because nobody doubts his commitment to left-wing policies, there may be less pressure on his campaign to embrace every idea floated by reporters or touted by activists. (It’s probably a good sign, for instance, that he was just attacked from the left by Julián Castro for insufficient zeal on reparations.) Nor does he need to adopt the strident tone of younger would-be revolutionaries or the politicians pandering to them to prove his socialist bona fides. As the conservative writer Ben Domenech noted recently, “the truth is that Sanders, despite his socialist label, seems to have a less harsh vision of politics than many others within the party.” Because his record is what it is, he won’t always have to be the most zealous candidate on stage — and like Reagan, he might even be able to promise certain kinds of moderation while keeping his base secure in his fundamentally revolutionary intentions. Of course this last possibility is just a hypothetical, and Sanders’s rumpled-professor style of socialism (and all those Soviet-friendly video clips lurking on YouTube) might ultimately inspire more backlash than Kamala Harris running hard to the left or Elizabeth Warren filling in all the policy details that Sanders leaves a little hazy. To argue that Sanders has qualities in common with Reagan is not to argue that he’s necessarily the most electable Democrat, or that in nominating him the party wouldn’t be taking a substantial risk — as Reagan really was a risky choice in 1980, and his victory by no means foreordained. But it is to argue that if you want a new president to be transformative — as, obviously, many people on the left desire — there are clear advantages in electing somebody whose entire career is associated with an ideological insurgency, and whose victory would shock the more adaptable sort of politician into understanding themselves as inhabitants of a new political reality, in which no matter what poll numbers show on any given issue, it’s taken for granted that the former world has passed away.

{"global_context": "With Hurricane Harvey pounding Texas, President Donald Trump is focusing more attention to the potentially catastrophic storm. Known for live-tweeting news events, Trump waited until midday Friday before firing off a message to inspire public confidence. \"I have spoken w/ @GovAbbott of Texas and @LouisianaGov Edwards,\" Trump tweeted just before noon. \"Closely monitoring #HurricaneHarvey developments & here to assist as needed.\" That was quickly followed by another tweet showing a photo of Trump getting a briefing on the hurricane from senior aides. More tweets about the storm followed as the day progressed. On Friday night, Trump announced he had signed a disaster proclamation at the request of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, R, to provide immediate federal aid even before the brunt of the hurricane had been felt. Trump departed the White House on Friday afternoon with first lady Melania Trump for Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, where he was maintaining contact with his homeland security team. \"Just arrived at Camp David where I am closely watching the path and doings of Hurricane Harvey, as it strengthens to a Category 3. BE SAFE!,\" Trump tweeted Friday afternoon. Saturday morning, the president again took to Twitter, praising FEMA Administrator Brock Long: \"You are doing a great job - the world is watching! Be safe.\" He also responded to Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, who Friday morning urged him to stay on top of the hurricane: \"@realDonaldTrump #hurricane keep on top of hurricane Harvey dont mke same mistake Pres Bush made w Katrina.\" Trump said: \".@ChuckGrassley - got your message loud and clear. We have fantastic people on the ground, got there long before #Harvey. So far, so good!\" Harvey made landfall Friday near Corpus Christi, Texas, as a Category 4 hurricane, bringing 130 mph sustained winds and driving rains. Harvey weakened to a tropical storm Saturday, but fear of flooding that could be brought on by torrential rains remains. He said he's watching from Camp David and praised officials' coordination. \"Closely monitoring #HurricaneHarvey from Camp David. We are leaving nothing to chance. City, State and Federal Govs. working great together!\" In the days leading up to the storm, the White House had exhibited little public urgency over what authorities projected as the first major hurricane to make landfall in the United States in a dozen years. The president began Friday morning with his usual stream of tweets about political grievances and settling scores with rivals, this time targeting Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn. \"Tennessee not happy!\" Trump proclaimed. But as the president's Friday posts make clear, it was the mood - and fate - of Texans in Harvey's path that is the more pressing matter. The Lone Star State was braced for a storm whose force the National Hurricane Center described as \"astounding.\" With winds greater than 140 miles per hour, Harvey struck north of Corpus Christi, the most powerful storm in the United States since Hurricane Wilma in 2005. Since the federal government's handling of Hurricane Katrina hobbled President George W. Bush's second term, the politics of natural disasters have turbocharged the stakes for presidents, governors and mayors in coastal regions. For a president who had no prior governing experience, the test is even more pronounced. Trump has proposed slashing Federal Emergency Management Agency grant funding to states and municipalities by $667 million. Brock Long, FEMA's director, was confirmed to the position in June after serving as Alabama's emergency management director and working as a private consultant. At the Department of Homeland Security, Elaine Duke has been serving as acting secretary since John F. Kelly moved to the White House as chief of staff late last month. Homeland security adviser Thomas Bossert, who had worked in FEMA's legislative division under Bush, emphasized that Trump has been fully briefed on the storm. In their meeting in the Oval Office on Friday morning, he said, Trump was focused on the safety of the up to 4.6 million people in the storm's projected path and ensuring that federal agencies providing support have the resources they need. White House aides have said Trump will visit Texas next week. The memories of Katrina's destruction and the Bush administration's failure are vivid in Washington. For those who served through major storms in the Bush and Obama administrations, the takeaway was clear: It is better to overprepare than to be caught off guard. Even if the federal response goes as well as could be expected, Mother Nature could still wreak significant death and destruction that could redound to the White House. \"The obvious lesson learned from Katrina is that strong executive involvement and oversight is necessary through the entire process,\" said Steve Atkiss, who served under Bush as special assistant for operations. During Katrina, the Category 5 hurricane in 2005 that flooded New Orleans, displaced thousands and killed more than 1,800 in Louisiana and Mississippi. Bush was at his ranch in Crawford, Texas. Though he cut short his vacation to return to Washington after water overwhelmed the levees in New Orleans, the crisis became a metaphor for a struggling administration preoccupied by faraway interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan. Atkiss said that Bush was fully engaged and that the decision for him to view the destruction from the window of Air Force One, rather than visit the city, was made out of fear that his presence would become a distraction for federal law enforcement.

{"global_context": "Donald Trump had remembered that Saturday evening in April, particularly the 2 minutes and 34 seconds Seth Meyers spent skewering him with joke after excoriating joke. It was 2015 - four years after the White House correspondents' dinner in which Trump had become Meyers's verbal punching bag - and the comic ran into the billionaire at Rockefeller Center during the \"Saturday Night Live\" 40th anniversary special. Meyers told Politico he seized the moment to make an impromptu pitch: Trump should come on \"Late Night.\" They could bill the appearance as a conciliatory meeting four years after the not-so-good-natured ribbing in front of President Barack Obama and a ballroom full of snickering journalists. Trump seemed amenable at the time, but later, Meyers told Politico, he made an intransigent demand: Apologize. Not a behind-the-scenes handshake, or a contrite text message, Meyers told Politico, but a public, on-air apology for making fun of Trump at the White House correspondents' dinner. Meyers refused, Trump declined and the appearance never happened. The incident instead became the subject of coffee-table conversation and, perhaps, an insight into the mind of an aggrieved Trump. The 2011 White House correspondents' dinner may be best known as the day Obama got a bit of revenge at Trump, one of the loudest voices in the birther movement that claimed that the U.S. president was not, in fact, a U.S. citizen. Obama quipped that, if elected, Trump would turn the White House into the \"Trump White House Resort and Casino.\" He said Trump, who flirted with the idea of running in the 2012 Republican primary, showed presidential leadership skills when he fired Gary Busey on \"The Apprentice.\" And, Obama said, now that he had released his birth certificate, Trump \"could finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter, like did we fake the moon landing; what really happened in Roswell.\" But before Obama lit into Trump, Meyers had worked him over, uttering the word \"Trump\" some 16 times, according to a transcript of the many jokes: \"Donald Trump has been saying he will run for president as a Republican, which is surprising since I just assumed he was running as a joke.\" \"Gary Busey said recently that Donald Trump would make a great president. Of course he said the same thing about an old rusty bird cage that he found.\" \"Donald Trump owns the Miss USA Pageant, which is great for Republicans since it will streamline their search for a vice president.\" \"Donald Trump said recently he has a great relationship with the blacks, but unless the Blacks are a family of white people I bet he is mistaken.\" Cutaways showed a stone-faced, unsmiling Trump enduring the fusillade. Years later, pundits wondered: Did that embarrassing night put Trump on a beeline trajectory to be the leader of the free world? Trump had spoken about running for president as early as 1988, but many said the night of Meyers' speech was a watershed moment. The New Yorker's Adam Gopnik wrote in September 2015 that he had been seated a few tables away from Trump in 2011. \"On that night, Trump's own sense of public humiliation became so overwhelming that he decided, perhaps at first unconsciously, that he would, somehow, get his own back - perhaps even pursue the presidency after all, no matter how nihilistically or absurdly, and redeem himself,\" Gopnik wrote. Of course that pursuit would make him an even bigger target for whoever happened to be headlining the White House correspondents' dinner. This year it was Michelle Wolf, who followed in Meyers' footsteps with a caustic diatribe directed at Trump. On Thursday, less than two weeks after that, she'll appear on Meyers' show.

The best way I can honor John McCain is help my country.” McCain, a former Republican presidential nominee and decorated veteran of the Vietnam War, was 81 when he died Saturday.

{"global_context": "Justice Kennedy retiring, giving Trump pivotal court pick. Justice Kennedy retiring, giving Trump pivotal court pick WASHINGTON — Justice Anthony Kennedy, the Supreme Court’s decisive man in the middle on abortion, gay rights and other contentious issues, announced his retirement Wednesday, giving President Donald Trump a golden chance to cement conservative control of the nation’s highest court. The 81-year-old Kennedy, often a voice of moderation over three decades on the court, provided the key vote on such closely divided issues as affirmative action, guns, campaign finance and voting rights in addition to same-sex marriage and the right to abortion. Kennedy informed his colleagues of his plans, then went to the White House to meet with Trump, where the president said they talked for half an hour about a potential successor and other topics. The retirement will take effect at the end of July. Trump praised Kennedy as a man of “tremendous vision” and said his search for a new justice would begin “immediately.” Without Kennedy, the court will be split between four liberal justices who were appointed by Democratic presidents and four conservatives who were named by Republicans. Trump’s nominee, likely to give the conservatives a solid majority, will face a Senate confirmation process in which Republicans hold the slimmest majority but Democrats can’t prevent a vote. ___ Analysis: GOP’s long-term Supreme Court strategy pays off NEW YORK — Three years of political upheaval. Early morning Twitter blasts. Scores of startling headlines. For the Republican Party, all the chaos of the Trump era has been building toward a week like this. The party’s long-term strategy to focus on the Supreme Court — highlighted by an audacious decision not to allow a vote in 2016 on President Barack Obama’s judicial pick — culminated this week with a series of conservative rulings and another vacancy. With Justice Anthony Kennedy set to retire at the end of next month, President Donald Trump is poised to appoint his second justice in as many years, giving conservatives a potential bulwark on the bench that could offset national demographic trends that appear set to favor Democrats in the decades ahead. Though Trump, who has little fixed ideology, has been an unpredictable and at times frustrating governing partner for the Republican leadership, he has largely adhered to GOP orthodoxy when it comes to judicial appointments, including his selection of Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court a year ago. And the president, in the moments after Kennedy’s retirement was announced, made clear that he understood the opportunity to shape the court for generations. “It’s always been considered a tremendous — a tremendously important thing,” the president said at the White House on Wednesday. “Some people think outside of, obviously, war and peace, it’s the most important thing that you could have.” White House aides signaled the president would look to quickly move toward announcing a nomination. And Senate Republicans said they would be willing to hold a confirmation vote this fall to replace Kennedy, a perennial swing vote on the court, despite Democratic cries of hypocrisy since the GOP refused to hold hearings on Obama’s choice of Merrick Garland because it was an election year. ___ Frustration, heartbreak for migrant parents looking for kids EL PASO, Texas — In an unmarked brick building a few blocks from the Mexican border, immigrant parents clutched folders of birth certificates and asylum paperwork and sat on folding chairs, waiting to use a single, shared landline phone. They rushed to the phone as their names were called with word that a relative or government worker was on the line, perhaps with news about their children. For days and weeks now, some of the hundreds of parents separated from their children at the Mexican border by the Trump administration have been battling one of the world’s most complex immigration systems to find their youngsters and get them back. For many, it has been a lopsided battle, and a frustrating and heartbreaking one. Most do not speak English. Many know nothing about their children’s whereabouts. And some say their calls to the government’s 1-800 information hotline have gone unanswered. Now, at least, they have the legal system on their side, since a federal judge in California ordered the Trump administration Tuesday night to reunite the more than 2,000 children with their parents in 30 days, or 14 days in the case of those under 5. ___ Trump admin struggling to comply with reunification mandate WASHINGTON — The Trump administration struggled Wednesday with how to abide by a federal judge’s order requiring that thousands of migrant children who were forcibly separated from their parents be reunited within 30 days. The hard deadline set Tuesday night by a U.S. District Judge in San Diego touched off a flurry of activity at facilities already coping with the aftermath of President Donald Trump’s order to end the separation of families at the border. In his order, U.S. District Court Judge Dana Sabraw, an appointee of President George W. Bush, said all families must be reunited within 30 days, and children under 5 must be reunited with their parents within 14 days. He also issued a nationwide injunction against further family separations, unless the parent is deemed unfit or doesn’t want to be with the child. Asked about the injunction, Trump offered no complaint, saying, “We believe the families should be together also so there’s not a lot to fight.” But it remained unclear Wednesday how the administration would meet that deadline, given the amount of red tape and confusion that has hung over the reunification process. ___ Trump dubs Heitkamp a ‘liberal Democrat,’ urges her defeat FARGO, N.D. — President Donald Trump urged voters Wednesday to fire “liberal Democrat” Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in November, claiming that she promised to be an independent mind but instead has voted in lockstep with her party leadership and against his agenda. Trump called instead for the election of Republican U.S. Rep. Kevin Cramer, one of his staunchest allies in Congress. “When Heidi ran for office, she promised to be an independent vote for the people of North Dakota,” Trump said to an arena packed with thousands of cheering supporters in Fargo. “Instead, she went to Washington and immediately joined Chuck ... and Nancy,” a reference to Democratic congressional leaders Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi. But Heitkamp, one of the most vulnerable incumbents seeking re-election this year, is considered a moderate and one of the least reliably partisan Democratic votes in the Senate. She’s largely backed the oil-rich state’s corporate interests on energy and has opposed some restrictions on guns. She voted to confirm 21 of Trump’s 26 Cabinet-level nominations. The president, however, noted Heitkamp’s votes against tax cuts he signed into law in December as well as the GOP’s long-sought goal to undo the health care program enacted by President Barack Obama. ___ Hate crime charges leveled after Charlottesville attack CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. — A reputed Hitler admirer accused of plowing a car into a crowd of protesters in Charlottesville, killing a young woman, was charged Wednesday with federal hate crimes in a case that stirred accusations last summer that President Donald Trump was giving a free pass to racists. James Alex Fields Jr., who already faced murder and other charges under Virginia law, was indicted on 30 additional federal charges stemming from the 2017 attack that killed 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injured dozens of others who had gathered to protest a rally of white nationalists. “At the Department of Justice, we remain resolute that hateful ideologies will not have the last word and that their adherents will not get away with violent crimes against those they target,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. “Last summer’s violence in Charlottesville cut short a promising young life and shocked the nation.” With his statement and the decision to bring the charges, Sessions struck a sharply different tone than the president, who sparked an uproar last year when he blamed the violence at the rally on “both sides.” Described by a former teacher as having a keen interest in Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler, Fields allegedly drove his speeding car into a group of people demonstrating against the “Unite the Right” rally. The Aug. 12 event drew hundreds of white nationalists to the college town, where officials planned to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. ___ Kennedy’s retirement roils election-year landscape NEW YORK — Nothing could have shifted the political landscape more than this. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement and President Donald Trump’s pledge to move quickly to fill the seat guarantee a searing summer of charged rhetoric that could touch on virtually every hot-button social and cultural issue in American politics. The news was especially deflating for Democrats, who felt immediate flashbacks to the 2016 presidential election, when the tantalizing prospect of an open Supreme Court seat spurred some GOP voters to back Trump even if they found him personally objectionable. It was a dramatic shift for Democrats who had been optimistic about seizing the House majority, if not the Senate. Some of the most dejected responded on social media with obscenities. Others teased a political strategy by warning of severe consequences for health care and abortion rights should Trump have his way. But for Republicans who have feared a massive enthusiasm advantage for Democrats, the sudden vacancy that could shape the court’s direction for a generation was nothing short of a gift from the political gods. In addition to a massive dose of energy, the Supreme Court fight is expected to trigger a flood of new campaign cash that will strengthen the GOP’s midterm efforts. ___ Mexicans want to throw out status quo in presidential vote MEXICO CITY — Mexicans fed up with corruption and violence say their country is poised for a historic transformation in Sunday’s presidential election, while others fear the vote will bring a freefall into populism and autocratic rule. The lightning rod for such divergent opinions is front-runner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the once-fiery leftist who has moderated his rhetoric and sought alliances across the political spectrum after two unsuccessful presidential runs and having led massive protests alleging electoral fraud. Despite his new image, the 64-year-old candidate universally called AMLO still appears to trust more in his own sense of mission than in the rules of modern economics and still vows to wrest control of the country back from the “mafia of power” that he has railed against for decades. Such is the level of discontent with Mexico’s political status quo, historically high homicide rates and rampant corruption that even his rivals are trying to convince voters that they represent “real change,” while simultaneously warning that a Lopez Obrador win would herald a Venezuela-like era of economic collapse and authoritarian rule. “What people have set as the priority in this election is no more of the same,” said economics graduate Rogelio Salgado, 30, who plans to vote for Lopez Obrador. “The point is to vote them all out of office, without exception.” ___ Fans throng Florida stadium, mourn slain rapper XXXTentacion FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — Loudspeakers blasted songs by the late rapper XXXTentacion as thousands of fans chanting his lyrics lined up for hours at a Florida stadium to see the performer laid out in a casket, two braids flowing over the side. XXXTentacion was gunned down last week at the age of 20 in what police said was an apparent robbery. His sudden death shocked fans and unleashed praise for a rapper described as both a gift and troubled figure in the world of music. XXXTentacion, who sported dreadlocks and facial tattoos and who pronounced his name “Ex ex ex ten-ta-see-YAWN,” was a platinum-selling rising star who tackled issues including prejudice and depression in his songs. He also drew criticism over bad behavior and multiple arrests, including charges that he severely beat and abused his girlfriend. On Wednesday, security guards flanked the casket, which was surrounded by black roses and silver leaves as a row of spotlights lit the stage at the 20,000-seat BB&T Center in Sunrise, Florida. Family members and friends gathered in a roped-off area and wore black T-shirts that said “Bad” on front and “No more pain” on the back. The somber crowd grew rowdy as popular songs came on and many started jumping and raising their hands in the air as they shouted lyrics. On the way into the arena as well as on stage near the casket, many fans wept openly, held hands and hugged each other. ___ Rescuers face scrutiny as 234 migrants reach safe haven VALLETTA, Malta — The captain of a German humanitarian ship that spent nearly a week searching for safe harbor before being allowed to bring 234 migrants rescued at sea to Malta on Wednesday declared during the odyssey: “Saving people is not a crime.” Still, once he was on land he was placed under investigation for allegedly breaching maritime regulations. It is part of a growing trend in Europe and the United States: Private groups responding to images of human suffering and deaths targeted by authorities who are often under political and popular pressure to stem the migration tides. In announcing that Captain Claus-Peter Reisch would face investigation, Malta’s Prime Minister Joseph Muscat placed the blame for the impasse that kept the migrants at sea while European nations haggled over their fate squarely on the captain, who he said went “against international rules and ignored directions.” French President Emmanuel Macron also criticized the captain, saying he “acted against all the rules,” by not turning the migrants over to Libyan authorities after they were found floating in rubber dinghies in Libyan waters. Humanitarian groups have pushed back. Doctors without Borders, Amnesty International and two other NGOs asked to meet with Macron over his assertion. “Engineered panic and fear-mongering by European politicians over migrations is steering the EU toward very dangerous waters,” Human Rights Watch said in a statement. Italy’s new, hard-line interior minister, Matteo Salvini, has been instrumental in raising the level of confrontation, closing Italian ports to humanitarian groups that he accuses of acting like taxi services for migrant smugglers operating out of lawless Libya. His refusal to grant safe harbor, coupled by that of Malta, forced the French aid ship Aquarius to sail an additional 900 miles (1,500 kilometers) to Spain, which agreed to take in the migrants at its port in Valencia.

Like many growers, Albert is considering whether to transition to sell recreational marijuana or remain solely a medical-marijuana supplier. (Photo: Trevor Hughes/USA TODAY) Marijuana sales in Maine may be delayed after the governor vetoed a proposed law establishing a system to license, tax and track cannabis sales. In a widely anticipated move, Republican Gov. Paul LePage rejected the bill Friday. Legalization advocates are now gearing up for a veto-override attempt. Maine’s voters last fall legalized marijuana and tasked lawmakers with developing a sales-and-monitoring system. In his veto message, LePage said he felt the proposal conflicted with federal law, sent the wrong message to kids about drug use and that legalization could lead to increased violence and car crashes in Maine. LePage also called on the federal government to clarify how it plans to address state-level marijuana legalization. “Until I clearly understand how the federal government intends to treat states that seek to legalize marijuana, I cannot in good conscience support any scheme in state law to implement expansion of legal marijuana in Maine,” LePage wrote. “If we are adopting a law that will legalize and establish a new industry and impose a new regulatory infrastructure that requires significant private and public investment, we need assurances that a change in policy or administration at the federal level will not nullify those investments.” More: In Maine, the marijuana comes to you Marijuana remains illegal at the federal level. While President Trump has said states should be allowed to make their own decisions, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has indicated the federal government may crack down. Legalization opponents cheered LePage’s decision, calling his veto of the \"reckless bill\" a victory for public health. \"It is clear the majority of Mainers would support an approach that puts health, safety, and families first-and not Big Marijuana,” Scott Gagnon, chairman of the group Smart Approaches to Marijuana Maine, said in a statement. Maine lawmakers are set to vote Monday on a veto override. If lawmakers override LePage, recreational sales could begin as soon as February. LePage previously asked legislators to push back implementation to 2019. Maine is one of eight states where voters have legalized recreational marijuana use for adults, although only a handful — Colorado, Oregon, Washington, Nevada and Alaska — have functioning marketplaces. California and Massachusetts are set to begin sales next year. While Washington, D.C. voters have legalized pot, the city cannot create a sales system until Congress agrees. In the interim, enterprising marijuana dealers in Main have been exploiting the state's lack of regulation and enforcement by giving away cannabis but charging hefty delivery fees.

LONDON — The mayor of London defended his decision to allow protesters to fly a giant “Trump baby” blimp over the city during President Donald Trump’s visit, saying disagreement was part of a fundamental freedom. London Mayor Sadiq Khan. Richard Heathcote / Getty Images file Sadiq Khan gave permission for the balloon, which was inflated with helium early Friday and floated over the Houses of Parliament during the demonstrations. \"The idea that we would park our rights and privileges and freedoms because it may cause offense to a U.S. president, I think people in London and the U.K. would find objectionable as indeed would Americans,” the mayor said. “We should cherish the fact they’ve got the right to [protest].” Trump, who was due to meet Queen Elizabeth II later Friday, has feuded with Khan, who is Muslim, over crime and immigration. ‘The wonderful thing about our city is the diversity. I hope you’ll realise it’s a strength not to be afraid of, but to be cherished.’ @SadiqKhan responds to Donald Trump comments this morning. pic.twitter.com/R8HM0TexKU — Good Morning Britain (@GMB) July 13, 2018 “Of course we stand shoulder to shoulder in adversity, and it was really comforting when Americans sent messages of support when we had terrorist attack last year,” Khan said, “but when we think you’re wrong we should say you’re wrong — that’s what a special relationship is all about.” Sadiq Khan on why he allowed the Trump baby blimp: \"Can you imagine if we limited freedom of speech because somebody's feelings might be hurt?\" #r4today — Emily Ashton (@elashton) July 13, 2018 Trump arrived in Britain on Thursday, and was expected to head to his golf resort in Scotland over the weekend. Demonstrators watch the Trump blimp being inflated Friday morning. Peter Nicholls / Reuters Hours after his arrival, he condemned Prime Minister Theresa May in an explosive interview in the Rupert Murdoch-owned Sun tabloid, in which he slammed her policy on Brexit. But on Friday morning, the president praised May. He also took aim again at Khan, saying: “I think allowing millions and millions of people to come into Europe is very, very sad. I look at cities in Europe, and I can be specific if you’d like. You have a mayor who has done a terrible job in London. He has done a terrible job.” Opposition lawmaker Emily Thornberry hit out at Trump’s comments, telling LBC radio: \"It's Islamophobia and it is racist. I'm afraid it is absolutely in Donald Trump's playbook. It just shows what a terrible president he is.\" Khan, who has no powers over immigration, also questioned the motives behind Trump’s repeated criticism. “Manchester also suffered a terror attack. … Paris Nice, Brussels, Berlin, cities in America have all suffered terror attacks, so it’s for President Trump to explain why he singled me as the mayor of London out,” he said. “It is for him to explain why he thinks I’m responsible for immigration into Europe or the U.K. I have no power over these things.” The latest chapter in the Trump-Khan feud came after a British lawmaker was accused of Islamophobia over a now-deleted tweet he posted about the London mayor.

{"global_context": "People who were turned back at airports in January are to get a letter from the government and a fair chance to reapply for entry. The travel ban was an attempt to fulfill Mr. Trump’s campaign promise of a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” The original version of the executive order imposing the ban was issued in January, barely a week after Mr. Trump’s inauguration. After that order was blocked in court, Mr. Trump issued a revised version, which will be the subject of arguments before the Supreme Court this fall. The initial imposition of the ban was widely viewed as a political debacle for the young administration. John F. Kelly, who was secretary of Homeland Security at the time and is now the White House chief of staff, confirmed that he had not seen the final order until after the president signed it. The White House had not asked the department for a legal review. Some border control officials arrived at work the following morning still unsure how to interpret the president’s order. Travelers from affected countries were already in the air on their way to the United States with valid visas when the executive order barring their entry was signed. Scores of refugees and immigrants found themselves trapped in airports across the country. Foreign students enrolled at American universities who had gone home for the winter holidays were blocked from returning. Legal permanent residents who had traveled for vacations or funerals were detained. Hameed Khalid Darweesh, the first named plaintiff in the case, arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport early in the evening, and watched his wife and three children pass successfully through passport control and customs and leave the arrivals area of the terminal, even as he was detained and held overnight and into the next day, much of the time in handcuffs. Mr. Darweesh, an Iraqi immigrant who had worked for the United States in his native country for years at great personal risk, became a symbol of the travel ban. One group of immigration lawyers put together a petition for a writ of habeas corpus overnight. The case was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, the International Refugee Assistance Project at the Urban Justice Center, the National Immigration Law Center, and Yale Law School’s Jerome N. Frank Legal Services Organization. Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

Lawyers ready to represent detained travelers without charge converged on Kennedy and other airports, and so did protesters with banners, chanting and calling for the release of detainees. A federal judge in Brooklyn ruled the next day, a Saturday, that the government could not deport the foreigners it was holding. It remains unclear exactly how many people were covered by the case settled on Thursday, or the extent of the ban’s consequences for them. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In a news briefing the week after the ban was announced, Customs and Border Protection said that a total of 721 people had been denied boarding for the United States after it began enforcing the travel ban. Many others boarded planes but were detained on arrival while officials sorted out what to do. Still others were put on flights back to their points of departure. One of the main goals of the settlement is to find those people. “Notwithstanding the administration’s claim at the time that few people were inconvenienced, documents now show that roughly 2,000 people from the seven listed countries were detained in connection with the first ban for various lengths of time in the immediate days after the order was issued,” said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the union’s Immigrants’ Rights Project. When the ban was revised in March, Iraq was removed from the list of predominantly Muslim countries covered by the ban. The revised version also exempted permanent residents and current visa holders, a significant scaling back of the ban’s scope. Even so, two federal appeals courts blocked some central parts of the revised ban. The Supreme Court agreed in June to decide whether the revised ban was lawful, and scheduled arguments for October.

Then came 2016, which gave Mr. Trump an eight-percentage-point win in Ohio and swept in a new state representative for the district that included Nelsonville, which had been held by a Democrat for the previous eight years. It was now held by a young Republican, Jay Edwards, who had been three years ahead of Mr. Sappington at Nelsonville-York High. He was a star quarterback who’d gone on to play linebacker at Ohio University, the scion of a prosperous local family.

Jay Edwards was in the audience, as both Mr. Sappington and another council member recall, and stood up to leave in the middle of his remarks. (Mr. Edwards declined to comment on the record about that meeting or the race.) A few months later, Mr. Sappington suffered another loss: the suicide of one of his cousins. A high school friend, a former service member , was succumbing to opiate addiction. The gloom seemed relentless. Mr. Sappington decided the best way to fight it was to have something else to think about. Late last year, he made up his mind to run against Mr. Edwards, to reclaim the 94th House District in the Ohio statehouse for the Democrats. He knew it would be a challenge. He was young. He would be vastly outspent. On the other hand, the district had been blue until very recently, and 2018 was promising to be a strong Democratic year.

{"global_context": "Trump administration moves to jail asylum seekers indefinitely in latest border crackdown. CLOSE President Donald Trump says that he is \"strongly looking at\" the idea of transporting migrants to so-called sanctuary cities that don't cooperate with federal immigration authorities. (April 12) AP WASHINGTON — Migrants who have shown credible fear of persecution or torture if they return to their countries will be jailed indefinitely in the United States under the Trump administration's latest effort to stem the surge of asylum seekers arriving at the border. Attorney General William Barr, who oversees immigration courts, on Tuesday directed judges to deny bond hearings for asylum seekers, guaranteeing migrants' detention while they wait for months, even years, for their claims to be heard. The decision, a departure from a years-long practice of allowing asylum seekers who have shown credible fear to seek bail, is all but assured to be challenged in court. Barr delayed the effective date of his ruling by 90 days, acknowledging that it will have \"an immediate and significant impact\" on already overcrowded detention centers. The Department of Homeland Security has requested for the delay so the agency \"may conduct necessary operational planning,\" Barr wrote in a footnote at the end of his 11-page ruling. Attorney General William Barr (Photo: Pete Marovich/epa-EFE) U.S.-Mexico border: Border apprehensions hit 12-year high in March as Trump vows 'tougher direction' 'Imminent threat': Yuma, Arizona, mayor declares emergency over migrant releases at border Civil rights organizations have promptly vowed to sue, saying the decision will result in unlawful and unnecessary detention of thousands of asylum seekers with valid claims. \"Barr's decision is the latest in the Trump administration's ongoing attack on individuals fleeing persecution and torture in their countries of origin,\" Trina Realmuto, attorney for the American Immigration Council, said in a statement. \"Rather than comply with recent district court order requiring prompt and fair bond hearings for asylum seekers before an immigration judge, the administration has elected instead to lock them up indefinitely.\" Realmuto is referring to a recent decision by a Seattle federal judge who ordered the government to promptly hold bond hearings for asylum seekers who have shown credible fear. U.S. District Judge Marsha Pechman ordered immigration courts to hold bond hearings within seven days of a request. Federal courts have blocked much of the Trump administration's hard-line policies meant to deter migrants from seeking asylum in the U.S. In San Francisco, U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg blocked the administration's policy of requiring Central-American asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their cases are decided in the U.S. A federal appeals judge later temporarily stopped that ruling from taking effect, keeping the administration's policy, more commonly referred to as \"Remain in Mexico,\" in place. In Washington, D.C., U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan ruled that the Trump administration overstepped its authority when it barred migrants from qualifying for asylum based on fears of domestic abuse or gang violence. Barr's decision comes as President Donald Trump has railed against the surge of migrants coming to the U.S. to seek asylum. \"You have people coming up, you know they're all met by the lawyers ... And they say, 'Say the following phrase: 'I am very afraid for my life. I am afraid for my life' ... It's a big fat con job, folks. It's a big fat con job,\" Trump told supporters in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in March. The president also has promised to end \"catch and release,\" a policy that requires the government to release migrant families and children from Central America into the U.S. while they wait for the outcome of their immigration or asylum cases. New acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan said at a recent Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that the policy has encouraged more migrants to come. Barr's decision, which requires migrants to be detained unless they're paroled, comes amid a record number of apprehensions at the border. Last month, Border Patrol agents apprehended more than 92,000 immigrants trying to cross the border, the highest tally in 12 years. The vast majority of these involved migrants who cross into the U.S. illegally to seek asylum. Barr's decision reverses an immigration judge's 2005 decision involving an Indian citizen who traveled to Mexico and crossed illegally into the U.S. to seek asylum. The Immigration and Nationality Act says that migrants who have shown credible asylum claims \"shall be detained for further consideration of the application for asylum,\" Barr wrote.

{"global_context": "A new petition urges the U.S. president to stay away. President Trump walks out to speak about the U.S. role in the Paris climate change accord in the Rose Garden at the White House, on June 1. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) It's a confusing decision for someone who ran as populist in chief, but: President Trump is going to Davos. On Tuesday, Trump announced that he'll attend at least part of the World Economic Forum, held at Davos, Switzerland. It's hard to imagine a worse fit. The forum is equal parts glitz and globalization, an opportunity for mostly liberal economic and cultural elites (think Bill Clinton, Bill Gates and Bono) to gather and chat about how great they're doing. The New York Times calls it “the world's most high-powered networking event.” This year's theme is “creating a shared future in a fractured world,” and the forum's website calls for an “unparalleled global effort in co-design, co-creation and collaboration.” In his first year in office, Trump railed against international agreements, pulled the United States out of trade pacts and climate deals and pushed an “America first” agenda. It's a surprise, too, because the forum is filled with journalists, celebrities and chief executives — exactly the kind of coastal elites Trump has criticized. (One of his 2016 campaign ads featured a shot of financier and philanthropist George Soros speaking at Davos as an example of the “global power structure” crushing the American worker.) A group of Swiss campaigners are so upset about Trump's decision to attend that they've launched a petition to keep him from the forum. Titled, “Trump not welcome — stay out of Davos,” the petition excoriates the president for his “inhumane politics” and his opposition to globalization. In just a few hours, it garnered about 5,000 signatures. “US President Donald Trump is on excellent terms with racism, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, sexism, misogyny, bellicosity, climate change denial, human rights abuse and a policy that deepens poverty and inequality,” the petition reads. “ … We want to put the ‘World First’ — not ‘America First.’ ” The petition took special issue with Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord last year. [How will Trump play at Davos?] Davos organizers, however, say they're ready to welcome Trump. According to Politico, forum organizers lobbied the administration for months to send high-level officials. No president has attended the forum since 2000. Trump aides say the World Economic Forum offers him an opportunity to sell his message to an international crowd. “The President welcomes opportunities to advance his America First agenda with world leaders,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement Tuesday. “At this year’s World Economic Forum, the president looks forward to promoting his policies to strengthen American businesses, American industries and American workers.” Politico reported that some West Wing advisers pushed Trump to use the conference as an opportunity to unleash “an especially gassy stink bomb aimed at ideas — free trade deals, a more integrated global regulatory system, and all manner of liberal pieties cherished by global elites — he deplores.” [Trump to attend World Economic Forum in Switzerland, a gathering synonymous with wealth and power].

{"global_context": "The Intercept reports that Ecuador will soon withdraw asylum protection from WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. The Intercept reports that Ecuador will soon withdraw asylum from WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has been claiming refuge in the country’s London embassy since 2012, citing fears that he will be extradited to the U.S. should he leave. Assange has held Ecuadorian citizenship since December 2017. Via The Intercept: A source close to the Ecuadorian Foreign Ministry and the President’s office, unauthorized to speak publicly, has confirmed to the Intercept that Moreno is close to finalizing, if he has not already finalized, an agreement to hand over Assange to the UK within the next several weeks. The withdrawal of asylum and physical ejection of Assange could come as early as this week. On Friday, RT reported that Ecuador was preparing to enter into such an agreement. The consequences of such an agreement depend in part on the concessions Ecuador extracts in exchange for withdrawing Assange’s asylum. But as former Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa told the Intercept in an interview in May, Moreno’s government has returned Ecuador to a highly “subservient” and “submissive” posture toward western governments. It is thus highly unlikely that Moreno – who has shown himself willing to submit to threats and coercion from the UK, Spain and the U.S. – will obtain a guarantee that the U.K. not extradite Assange to the U.S., where top Trump officials have vowed to prosecute Assange and destroy WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks and Assange attracted mainstream vilification during the 2016 election campaign for its role in distributing leaked Democratic National Committee, showing that, among other things, the DNC colluded with the Clinton campaign against Bernie Sanders. WikiLeaks also revealed the close ties between tech giant Google and the Clinton campaign. Special Counsel Robert Mueller has since indicted 12 Russian nationals as the alleged culprits of the DNC hack, although Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein emphasized that there was “no allegation” that Americans communicating with the hackers “knew they were corresponding with Russian intelligence officers.” Assange has denied that his source was the Russian government or a state party.

But then he found himself engulfed in a controversy that at once undermined his MLK day message and raised questions about his temperament and attitudes towards race, having to address accusations that he called African nations, in so many words, \"shithole countries.\" This turbulent day provided the most striking juxtaposition to date between two visions of the Trump presidency. In one, Trump is a transformative president whose vow to make America great again extends to Americans of all classes and races. In the other, his not-so-thinly-veiled appeals to white supremacy have divided the country and reversed a half-century of progress on race relations. Both were on display Friday. \"Today, we celebrate Dr. King for standing up for the self-evident truths Americans hold so dear: that no matter what the color of our skin, or the place of our birth, we are created equal by God,” Trump said, signing a proclamation for the King holiday in a room of African-American officials, pastors, and political leaders. Moments later, Trump ignored questions from reporters who asked, \"Mr. President, are you a racist?\" CLOSE After President Trump made disparaging remarks about immigrants, some members of the Haitian communities in New York and Florida said they were offended and believed his comments were racist. AP The day before, Trump had told a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the White House that he'd rather have more immigrants from Norway and fewer from \"shithole counties\" in Africa and reportedly asked, \"Why do we need more Haitians? Take them out.\" Trump denied using that exact language, but one senator in the room, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., confirmed he said it. \"He used those words, and he used them repeatedly,\" Durbin said. Republicans who were there either didn't deny it or said they couldn't remember it — but distanced themselves from Trump's statement. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said the president's remarks were \"not helpful\" in reaching a compromise on an immigration bill. The alleged epithet — translated into dozens of languages and even more colorful euphemisms — sparked an international backlash. A United Nations spokesman effectively called the president a racist.

It depends who you ask More: Paul Ryan: Trump's comments on immigration 'unhelpful' More: U.N., African countries blast Trump's 'racist' words in angry global backlash Domestic critics questioned Trump's fitness for office and accused him of promoting notions of white supremacy. It wasn't the first time Trump derailed his own agenda with his incendiary brand of 140-character rhetoric. Not was it the first time those comments have drawn him into the precarious debate over some of the less noble chapters of American history. Indeed, Trump's very candidacy was born in birtherism, the debunked conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was an illegitimate president because he was born in Kenya. He has referred to Mexicans as rapists. He has attacked African-American athletes protesting police violence by kneeling during the national anthem. And he appeared to assign equal blame to white nationalist marchers and counter-protesters after clashes in Charlottesville left one woman dead. More: 5 other times President Trump's remarks sparked controversy over race Michele Lamont, a Harvard professor who studies sociology, Africa and African-American studies, examined Trump's appeals to the working class in 73 campaign speeches. She said Trump's racial rhetoric has gotten even more explicit since his inauguration. But the target audience — older, white, working class voters — is the same. \"The fact of naming these countries as 'shitholes' is a way to assert the dominance of the U.S. over the world,\" she said. \"It’s not only about the content of what he's saying, it’s the way he's saying it. To use this vulgar language that they hear as unfiltered and uncensored, plays into the sense of authenticity among the white working class that he's one of them.\" But even as these comments spark controversy, Trump has also tried to portray himself as a civil rights candidate and president. Last February, he signed an executive order to move HBCU policy — dealing with historically black colleges and universities — into the White House. He signed a bill this week to expand King's birthplace in Atlanta into a national historical park, and another one Friday to expand the national historic site at Little Rock Central High School, the ground zero of desegregated schools. And he boasted that the African American unemployment rate was at an all-time low under his administration. \"Dems did nothing for you but get your vote! #NeverForget,\" he tweeted. More: Trump signs bill to upgrade Martin Luther King's birthplace to national historic park This time, the comment was in a private Oval Office meeting to discuss immigration. But it was explosive in part because it came during sensitive negotiations over an immigration bill that could decide which countries the United States will accept immigrants from and which will have the door closed. After being invited into the White House to celebrate the proclamation signing, a gaggle of African-American Trump loyalists spoke to reporters outside. \"We often times forget that the president is the president of all the people, of all Americans, Republicans, Democrats, big states, small states, of the forgotten people who put him into office,\" said Paris Dennard of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, after leaving the MLK proclamation ceremony. \"It's also important that we give the president that credit he deserves.\" One after another, they vouched for the president's character, ignoring questions about the racial overtones of Trump's immigration language. \"God bless you. Thank you. No questions,\" said Darrell Scott, an Ohio pastor, turning and walking back into the White House.

{"global_context": "The Border Patrol's Tucson sector has followed in the footsteps of its counterparts in Yuma and is releasing families into the community in Tucson. CLOSE Sen. Kyrsten Sinema met with nonprofit leaders, federal authorities and local officials on improving how migrants are released into communities. Diana Payan, The Republic | azcentral.com TUCSON, Ariz. – Border Patrol officials have begun releasing migrant families in Tucson because they lack the space to detain them and immigration officials are unable to take them into custody. The practice has been going on for about a month, according to the Border Patrol's Tucson sector, which covers most of Arizona's border with Mexico. It was a central topic of a meeting Border Patrol officials in Tucson held Friday with local law-enforcement, elected and community leaders. The number of migrant families released in Tucson has surpassed the ability of local nonprofits to house them. This past week, the city of Tucson and Pima County opened temporary overflow shelters to house migrants, although those shelters are once again empty, at least for now. 'Zero tolerance' update: Judge gives Trump team 6 months to identify additional separated migrant families The goal of Friday's meeting was to \"alleviate some of the stressors that we've been seeing with this increase in people,\" said Pete Bidegain, a special-operations supervisor for the Border Patrol. \"One of the major concerns that was brought up numerous times in the meeting really comes down to better communication between federal officials, county officials, city officials,\" he added. One of the big takeaways, Bidegain said, is the possibility of giving nonprofits and city leaders an earlier heads-up as soon as border officials notice any increases in the numbers of migrants they encounter at the border. \"That heads-up may be hours or it may be days,\" he said. \"But any type of communication, just keeping that open, is going to help us and it's also going to help them.\" Border Patrol has not disclosed how many migrants it has released directly into Tucson in the past month since it began the practice, which the agency officially refers to as migrants released on their own recognizance. As they are released, the migrants are issued notices to appear in court at later dates. States' legislative walls: Trump changes in immigration policy slowed, but states are cranking out their own new laws The direct releases of migrants add to an already unique situation that has strained existing resources in Tucson. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency that normally takes custody of asylum-seeking families once they have been processed, has continued releasing families in Tucson. That includes migrants apprehended in the Tucson sector as well as migrants who crossed through the Yuma area. Pima County officials estimate that ICE has released about 7,000 migrants in Tucson in the past eight months. On top of that, Border Patrol officials in El Paso have been busing hundreds of migrants each day to Tucson so they can be released there instead of El Paso, which has also been struggling greatly with the sheer number of migrant families. As a result, when ICE is unable to take migrants into custody, Border Patrol has begun releasing families directly in Tucson. Border Patrol works with nonprofits to find space to house the migrants, but it doesn't always work out. \"If they are at capacity, that's when the decision is made to release people out into the community, and that's traditionally been done ... at local transportation hubs,\" Bidegain said. The Wall: A 2,000-mile search for answers That's something both city leaders and nonprofits want to avoid. Their concern is that, if left to fend for themselves, families will end up stranded or unable to navigate the transportation system in an unfamiliar country. Tucson Mayor Jonathan Rothschild, who attended the Friday meeting, said that was one of the big concerns he took from the Border Patrol discussion. \"If the loaded buses from Border Patrol can go not to the bus station, but to the site of where the (nonprofit) is located, that would be a big help because that saves us a lot as a community,\" Rothschild said. Another concern Rothschild brought up was that migrant families from El Paso were being transported to and released in Tucson. He said such a move made little sense, especially when the asylum-seeking families were headed to the Eastern United States. \"If they're moving east, why would you ever move them west?\" he said. More: New Mexico city asks for donations as Border Patrol drops off migrants for the first time Border Patrol officials said they would consider the concerns. As a result of the meeting, Bidegain said, they also agreed to create a steering committee to help implement some of the ideas discussed. The committee would be composed of nonprofits, as well as representatives from the local, state and federal levels. Have any news tips or story ideas about the U.S.-Mexico border?

{"global_context": "He now plays down his role overhauling crime laws with segregationist senators in the ’80s and ’90s. That portrayal today is at odds with his actions and rhetoric back then. Mr. Biden apologized in January for portions of his anti-crime legislation, but he has largely tried to play down his involvement, saying in April that he “got stuck with” shepherding the bills because he was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. But an examination of his record — based on newly obtained documents and interviews with nearly two dozen longtime Biden contemporaries in Washington and Delaware — indicates that Mr. Biden’s current characterization of his role is in many ways at odds with his own actions and rhetoric. Mr. Biden arrived in the Senate in 1973 having forged close ties with black constituents but also with law enforcement, and bearing the grievances of the largely white electorate in Delaware. He courted one Southern segregationist senator, James O. Eastland of Mississippi, who helped him land spots on the committee and subcommittees dealing with criminal justice and prisons, and became a close friend and legislative partner of another, Strom Thurmond of South Carolina. While Mr. Biden has said in recent days that he and Mr. Eastland “didn’t agree on much of anything,” it is clear that on a number of important criminal justice issues, they did. As early as 1977, Mr. Biden, with Mr. Eastland’s support, pushed for mandatory minimum sentences that would limit judges’ discretion in sentencing. But perhaps even more consequential was Mr. Biden’s relationship with Mr. Thurmond, who became his co-author on a string of bills that effectively rewrote the nation’s criminal justice laws with an eye toward putting more criminals behind bars. In 1989, with the violent crime rate continuing to rise as it had since the 1970s, Mr. Biden lamented that the Republican president, George H. W. Bush, was not doing enough to put “violent thugs” in prison. In 1993, he warned of “predators on our streets.” And in a 1994 Senate floor speech, he likened himself to another Republican president: “Every time Richard Nixon, when he was running in 1972, would say, ‘Law and order,’ the Democratic match or response was, ‘Law and order with justice’ — whatever that meant. And I would say, ‘Lock the S.O.B.s up.’”.

{"global_context": "A year ago, as the Trump Era was dawning in Washington, I peered into the future and tried to predict what we should expect from our strange new president. “We should give Trump a chance,” I wrote before his inauguration, a chance to keep his promises to “grow jobs, improve healthcare, drain the swamp and be a president for all Americans.” “I’m going to keep an open mind,” I promised, “look for signs of wisdom and virtue in his new administration, and give him credit if I find it.” I’m still looking. At the end of the year, pundits owe their readers an accounting of what they got wrong over the last 12 months — and what, if anything, they got right. Here’s what I got wrong about President Trump during 2017: I underestimated Trump’s determination to deport immigrants who entered the country illegally. After covering his campaign, I expected Trump to govern with the quirky combination of conservatism and working-class populism that helped him win. I figured he would focus relentlessly on blue-collar jobs, which would mean infrastructure spending and trade reform as well as tax cuts. Instead, in office, Trump has governed like a plutocrat. His economic program has consisted of little more than tax cuts for business owners, plus deregulation. (Yes, the tax bill included middle-class tax cuts, too, but they evaporate at the end of 2025.) His promise to spend billions on infrastructure has been sidelined. And he hasn’t done much to stop American jobs from moving overseas. His trade policy has been mostly threats, with little action. When it comes to economics, our purportedly populist president has been captured by the Republican business establishment. I fully expected Trump to continue his attacks on the norms of American democracy: the rule of law, civil discourse, freedom of the press and racial tolerance. But I didn’t think he’d escalate those attacks. When demonstrations in Charlottesville, Va., turned violent, Trump resisted blaming the white supremacists who started the melee. He waded needlessly into the controversy over Confederate statues — a local issue, not a federal question. He attacked African American NFL players for kneeling during the national anthem, and African American basketball players for being insufficiently grateful when he arranged their release from jail in China. Almost alone among major American politicians, he can’t bring himself to condemn racism clearly — a cynical political strategy to keep the culture war white-hot. I also underestimated Trump’s determination to deport immigrants who entered the country illegally, including many who have established families and integrated into communities. “His bark may prove worse than his bite,” I suggested. Wrong again. In the first nine months of his presidency, detentions and removals soared — including a 250% increase in arrests of immigrants with no criminal record. But Trump has been less disruptive than I feared in one area: foreign policy. Defense Secretary James N. Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and national security advisor H.R. McMaster appear to have tempered the president’s incendiary instincts — so far, at least. Trump threatened to unleash “fire and fury” against North Korea but has allowed Tillerson to continue trying diplomacy instead. He threatened to scrap the international agreement blocking Iran from nuclear weapons but settled for demanding new sanctions. He threatened to walk away from U.S. military obligations to NATO but accepted an increase in European defense spending. He’s still eroding the alliances the United States built after World War II and reducing American influence around the world. But he hasn’t started a war. (I promised to give credit where credit was due, remember?) I did manage to get a few things right over the course of the year. I suggested that the economy would continue growing, especially with promises of tax cuts in the air. “Although Republicans hated the idea of stimulus when it bore President Obama’s name, watch them hail Trump’s as an act of genius,” I wrote. I forecast that Obamacare would survive GOP attempts at repeal — and that “more voters may demand a single-payer plan” once they considered the alternatives. And I suggested that one of the big challenges for journalists — and citizens, too — would be distinguishing between important problems and trivial ones in a chaotic, noisy presidency. “We should try to stop chasing shiny objects and focus on the most important issues,” I counseled. And, I argued, we should aim to “normalize” Trump — not in the sense of pretending what he does is normal, but in the sense of holding him to high standards. We should “demand that Trump normalize himself, because he’s the only one who can,” I wrote. “We should ask him to be normal. We should demand that he do what he said he would do on election night: try to unite the country.” Twelve months later, that’s still a pretty good description of the task we face as we head into 2018, this time with a congressional election ahead. * Finally, a personal note: I won’t be writing twice a week for this page any more.

{"global_context": "At a time when the Democratic base is more restive than it has been in decades, Sen. Dianne Feinstein ignited a firestorm earlier this week when she refused to back the impeachment of President Trump and instead called for “patience” over his presidency. The statements — provocative in Democratic circles and near-heretical in her hometown of San Francisco, where she made them — reflected a moderation and pragmatism that have been hallmarks of Feinstein’s career. But these qualities, after proving politically advantageous for decades, could become an albatross because of the state’s shifting demographics and political leanings as the 84-year-old decides whether to seek a sixth term. Potential rivals are already circling. Senate President Pro Tem Kevin De León lashed out at Feinstein’s remarks hours after she made them Tuesday at the Commonwealth Club, saying that women, children, people of color, immigrants and members of the LGBTQ community had little time for patience in the face of the president’s policies. On Thursday, he reiterated his disappointment in the state’s senior senator. “It wasn’t the proper tone or tenor, especially given the current state of politics at the national level,” De León, who is termed out and rumored to be considering a Senate run, said in an interview with The Times. “We don’t owe Trump patience. We owe Californians resistance.” De León’s words were a remarkable rebuke from a top California Democrat of one of the state’s most powerful and venerated leaders. They were also a reflection of how the political landscape in California in 2017 — in the aftermath of the election of Trump and amid simmering rage from the Democratic party’s most liberal activists — is dramatically different from the era when Feinstein gained political prominence. She was booed at a 1990 California Democratic Party convention for flaunting her support for the death penalty. But the resulting image of a defiant Feinstein staring into a camera as her party denounced her was beamed around the state as a testament to her independence. She won her Senate seat two years later, and hasn’t faced a competitive race in two decades. Sean Clegg, a veteran Democratic operative in San Francisco and a top advisor to Sen. Kamala Harris, said Feinstein’s Trump statements reflect a similar candor about her beliefs — even when they conflict with her audience. But her measured tones may not resonate with voters now, when the political environment is far more partisan and sharply divided than when she first joined the Senate. “It’s Dianne being Dianne, but it’s greatly out of step with where the base is, where most Democrats are, and where most California voters are,” he said. “The base is on fire like we really have not seen in more than a generation.” It’s Dianne being Dianne, but it’s greatly out of step with where the base is, where most Democrats are, and where most California voters are. — Sean Clegg, a veteran Democratic strategist The fury is acute in California, where Democrats have positioned themselves as the liberal resistance to Trump. The state is home to some of the president’s most vocal critics: Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) has been calling for Trump’s impeachment for months, and Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Porter Ranch) introduced articles of impeachment on the House floor in July, accusing the president of obstructing justice. Others, such as Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Torrance), have loudly declared their opposition to many of Trump’s policies. Feinstein has also criticized Trump’s policymaking and rhetoric, such as his pardon of former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, and his comments assigning blame to “many sides” after last month’s violent neo-Nazi and white supremacist protests in Charlottesville, Va. But the comments Feinstein made about Trump on Tuesday — urging patience and saying she believed he could be a good president if he learned and changed — reinforced the notion among some liberals that Feinstein has grown out of touch with her constituents. “No politician is entitled to their office, and what’s needed now more than ever are independent progressive leaders who will be champions for the working Californians hurt by the hateful, divisive policies of the Trump presidency,” said Joe Sanberg, a wealthy Westwood investor whose work to address poverty — he successfully pushed the state to enact income tax credits for the working poor — could be a springboard for a future run for office. A Democratic member of the California congressional delegation, who requested anonymity to candidly discuss a colleague, said some politicians eager to seek higher office and see new faces in party leadership believe it’s time for Feinstein to “pass the torch.” The lawmaker suggested there is particular frustration with Feinstein’s remarks about “patience” among politicians who represent districts with large minority populations. Their constituents are afraid, and they believe there is no time to waste fighting Trump, the Democrat said. “They want resistance.” Follow California politics by signing up for our email newsletter » Feinstein’s top political advisor declined to comment on Feinstein’s remarks, but several supporters defended her comments and her record representing California in the Senate for a quarter century. Longtime Feinstein confidant and former Rep. Ellen Tauscher, who represented the East Bay for 12 years, moderated Tuesday’s event. Tauscher said the senator’s remarks were taken out of context, but emphasized that they also displayed the characteristics she believes have made Feinstein a powerful advocate for California in the Senate.

{"global_context": "Congressional Republicans tried to make sense Thursday of President Donald Trump's early-morning tweets on immigration and children's health, as the GOP struggled to muster the votes for a short-term spending bill and avert a government shutdown at midnight Friday. With less than 48 hours before a possible shutdown, Trump on Twitter seemed to directly contradict the legislative strategy of congressional Republicans by calling for the separation of a long-term extension of the popular Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) from a short-term spending bill to keep the government open through mid-February. While some Republicans suggested that the president was endorsing the GOP's approach, albeit sloppily, others found the tweets inexplicable and unhelpful ahead of the November midterm elections. \"We don't have a reliable partner at the White House to negotiate with,\" Sen. Lindsey O. Graham, R-S.C., said as he walked into the Capitol. \"This has turned into an s-show for no good reason, and the only way out of this thing is to grow up a little bit - and I think that's going to happen,\" he said. The back-and-forth was reminiscent of the chaos that erupted last week after Trump tweeted criticism of an intelligence bill that his administration had endorsed the day before. Some Republican aides said Trump was trying to be helpful with his tweet. \"I think people are misreading this,\" tweeted Brett Horton, chief of staff to House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La. \"The president wants a long-term reauthorization [solution] for CHIP, and this CR does exactly that.\" Republicans' goal is to force Democrats into the uncomfortable position of choosing between funding CHIP and their effort to win legal protections for hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants. The GOP was prepared to target Democrats for opposing the short-term spending with the six-year extension of the children's health program. The election-year attack would involve letters from governors and statistics from individual states, according to a senior aide. \"It's just confusing. I don't know what he means. I don't know why he's doing that,\" this person said about Trump's tweets. House Republicans hoped to hold a vote as soon as Thursday on the short-term spending bill with the health insurance program attached. Changing the bill could delay its consideration. The bill would keep the government open through Feb. 16 while extending CHIP and rolling back several taxes in the Affordable Care Act. In several tweets before 9 a.m., Trump blamed Democrats for a possible shutdown. \"CHIP should be part of a long term solution, not a 30 Day, or short term, extension!\" Trump tweeted. \"A government shutdown will be devastating to our military . . . something the Dems care very little about!\" he wrote. If the government closes, it will be the first time under unified party control of Congress and the White House. The White House on Wednesday had endorsed the short-term funding bill, but by Thursday, support had eroded further in the Senate as Sens. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., and Angus King, I-Maine, indicated that they would oppose it. Early Thursday, some Republicans signaled that their patience with the president was wearing thin. Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., said that the level of support in the House for the short-term bill is unclear and that extending CHIP would help avoid a shutdown. \"A lot of House Republicans want a six-year extension. It's important to us,\" he said. \"That's just another one of those inexplicable tweets that's not very helpful.\" Another Republican, Rep. Mark Sanford of South Carolina, said he was uncertain how he would vote on the bill. \"It seems to be a work in progress. No one has completely pinned down what's coming next,\" he said. Told of Trump's tweets, Sanford said: \"It's fluid, topsy-turvy, whichever you prefer.\" House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, R-Wis., did not comment on Trump's tweets or a possible shutdown at an early Thursday appearance at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. In an appeal to defense hawks, he called for a boost in Pentagon spending and criticized Democrats for using the military \"as a bargaining chip for completely unrelated items.\" \"The defense budget is being held hostage for DACA,\" he said, referring to the program for young undocumented immigrants that Trump is ending in March. \"It's completely unrelated, and those are the partisan games that are being played right now.\" The last shutdown occurred in 2013 and lasted 16 days as Republicans tried unsuccessfully to force changes to the Affordable Care Act. Shuttered national parks and monuments have become a symbol of shutdowns past, and the Trump administration is drawing up plans to keep them open despite the closure as a means to blunt public anger. The prospects for passage of the spending bill in the Senate were dicey. Several Democrats who had approved earlier short-term spending extensions announced Wednesday that they would be voting \"no\" this time around. They were under intense pressure from activists to hold firm on demands for a solution for the young undocumented immigrants known as \"dreamers\" who face losing protections against deportation that were yanked by the Trump administration. \"President Trump and the Republicans have a choice: They can either come to the table and negotiate in good faith on a responsible funding agreement and protection for dreamers - or they can cause a government shutdown,\" said Sen. Tom Udall, N.M., one of those Democrats. In the House, Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, R-N.C., left an evening meeting with Chief Deputy Whip Patrick T. McHenry, R-N.C., saying that he had not been won over and that the short-term spending bill expected to come to the floor on Thursday remained short of votes. \"We're making good progress, yet still at this point if the vote were to happen today there's not the votes to fund it with Republican-only votes,\" Meadows said. His group is pushing for greater defense spending, among other things. The defections left the outlook uncertain, leaving open the possibility that the government will shut down Friday at midnight. GOP leaders in both chambers insisted that such an outcome would be avoided, and members of the House vote-counting team expressed guarded optimism that they would be able to round up the necessary support in time for Thursday's vote. Still, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said there is a \"good chance\" that the bill will pass in the upper chamber. \"We'll be taking that up as soon as it comes over from the House,\" he said.

{"global_context": "A second proposal to shut the rural school is withdrawn, so public objections can be considered. The CCMS proposed closing the school in 2014 and again this year, due to its falling enrolment Plans to close a small rural secondary school in County Fermanagh have been halted for a second time, after parents and pupils campaigned to keep it open. St Mary's High School in Brollagh was first threatened with closure in 2014, but the then education minister, John O'Dowd, decided it should stay open. In September this year, a new proposal to shut the school was published. But that proposal has now also been withdrawn, so officials can consider public objections to the closure. 'Wider solution' Campaigners said parents and pupils cried tears of \"relief\" when the U-turn was announced on Thursday. However, education officials told BBC News NI they will consider the objections raised before \"revisiting the proposal\" within the context of a \"wider area solution\". The high school, near Belleek, is managed by the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS). The CCMS wanted to close the school in 2014 due to its falling enrolment. At that time, St Mary's had 121 pupils, far below the recommended minimum number. Since then, numbers have fallen further and currently there are 86 pupils enrolled. 'Long journeys' The County Fermanagh school is in a rural location, just a short distance from the Irish border. St Mary's had previously approached schools in County Donegal and County Leitrim in order to form cross-border partnerships, but these did not develop. Campaigners who objected to the closure of St Mary's complained it would lead to a further erosion of public services in a deprived rural area. They also pointed out that schoolchildren who already faced long journeys to school would be forced to travel even further for their education. The school's former principal left his post at the end of October and an acting principal, Simon Bradley, was appointed to take charge. 'Difficult process' Mr Bradley was informed of latest U-turn in a statement from the CCMS. It said: \"At its recent meeting, the Education Committee discussed the issues raised during the public objection period to the proposal to cease provision at St Mary's High School, Brollagh. \"Having given these matters their due consideration, the committee has determined that they wish to withdraw the current development proposal. \"The committee did, however, emphasise their commitment to addressing the educational needs of the children in the Brollagh area and so will revisit the proposal subject to exploration of a wider area solution.\" The CCMS also thanked staff and school governors, acknowledging it had been a \"difficult process\".

{"global_context": "Trump's preoccupation with getting allies to spend 2% on defense often misrepresents their NATO obligations. CLOSE President Donald Trump singles out Germany Thursday for not paying their NATO commitments during a meeting at the White House with Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. (May 17) AP President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump walk down the stairway of Air Force One as they arrive at Melsbroek Military airport in Melsbroek, Belgium, TuesdayTrump is in Brussels to attend a two-day NATO summit. (Photo: Geert Vanden Wijngaert, AP) BRUSSELS — President Donald Trump arrived Tuesday at the home of NATO headquarters with a seemingly singular preoccupation: allies who aren't sharing in the burden of providing for the collective defense. His rallying cry: \"2 percent.\" That's the amount NATO members are expected to spend on defense as a share of their economies. Only four of 29 allies meet that target. The latest salvo came in two tweets from Air Force One, in which he misrepresented the arrangement by which allies contribute to their joint defense. The squabbling over who pays for the protection afforded by the alliance has already set a combative tone for the two-day NATO summit in Brussels this week, as the allies discuss its response to Russia's growing military, political and cyber incursions into Europe. \"Many countries in NATO, which we are expected to defend, are not only short of their current commitment of 2% (which is low), but are also delinquent for many years in payments that have not been made. Will they reimburse the U.S.?\" Trump tweeted. A 2014 agreement did require members to increase defense spending, with a goal of contributing 2 percent of the nation's economic output by 2024. But more importantly, that spending is on their own defense forces — not payments to the United States. But Trump is correct that only four NATO members — the United States, the United Kingdom, Estonia and Greece — currently meet the 2 percent expectation. A fifth country, Poland, fell to 1.99 percent his year, as faster-than-expected economic growth outpaced defense budgets. Diplomats say Trump's singular focus on the 2 percent benchmark might be counterproductive. \"The more he harangues allies, and the more he makes this the defining issue, the more difficult it will be for some allies actually to increase spending,\" said Ivo Daalder, the U.S. ambassador to NATO from 2009 to 2013. \"Given that Trump’s popularity in Europe is at an historic low for a US president, acceding to his demands is becoming more difficult for many European leaders.\" European Council President Donald Tusk suggested as much Tuesday. “Dear America, appreciate your allies. After all, you don’t have that many,\" he said in Brussels ahead of Trump's visit. \"We do have a lot of allies, but we cannot be taken advantage of,\" Trump responded. \"We're being taken advantage of by the European Union.\" Trump has tied the issue of defense spending to his larger trade wars, saying the United States should not be subsidizing nations with which it runs a trade deficit. \"The European Union makes it impossible for our farmers and workers and companies to do business in Europe (U.S. has a $151 Billion trade deficit), and then they want us to happily defend them through NATO, and nicely pay for it,\" Trump tweeted. \"Just doesn’t work!\" One particular target of Trump's displeasure has been German Chancellor Angela Merkel. \"Germany pays 1 percent. One percent,\" Trump said at a campaign rally last week. \"And I said, you know, Angela, I can't guarantee it, but we're protecting you, and it means a lot more to you than protecting us because I don't know how much protection we get by protecting you.\" Germany's actual spending is 1.24 percent of its gross domestic product. But experts say Trump's focus on the percentage of defense spending only captures one dimension of an ally's contribution. Germany's government, for example, approved an increase in troops to serve in Afghanistan, to 1,300. And other countries include military pensions in its totals, which is effectively spending on past defense. Trump's excessive fixation on defense spending ignores those contributions, argues Jeffrey Rathke, the co-author of a recent study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies on NATO burden sharing. He also said the NATO figures don't take into account civilian spending that helps boost defense, like diplomatic efforts and training of local defense forces. Trump's frequent complaints about defense spending also obscure the fact that European defense spending is going up — even by Trump's own measure. Nineteen of the 29 members spend more on defense than they did in 2014, and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said half are on pace to meet the target by 2024. There are a lot of reasons for that: New threats from Russia following its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, an improving European economy, and U.S. pressure under both President Barack Obama and, more pointedly, Trump. \"Trump can claim some credit for the increase,\" said Daalder, Obama's NATO ambassador. \"The allies are certainly willing to give it to him if he were to recommit fully to NATO and collective defense.\" Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2L2iW0y.

Bush and Barack Obama, and that while he didn't always agree with their policy, he \"never doubted that each treated their solemn responsibility to lead our nation with anything less than the seriousness, intellectual rigor and principles that it deserved.\" That changed with Trump for Brennan. \"Mr. Trump, however, has shown highly abnormal behavior by lying routinely to the American people without compunction, intentionally fueling divisions in our country and actively working to degrade the imperfect but critical institutions that serve us.\" Brennan's criticism of Trump is nothing new, the former intelligence official notes, and he's been slammed in the past for going after the president. In March, Brennan tweeted \"America will triumph over you\" while retweeting a Trump post that called ex-FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe's firing \"a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI.\" He also called Trump a \"deeply flawed person\" after the president used a vulgar term to refer to people from Haiti and other foreign nations. Brennan served as CIA director and Homeland Security adviser under Obama.

As many as 594,843 votes, or 8.4 percent, of the 7.64 million votes cast, were invalid and spoiled, figures from the National Election Committee showed. By comparison, spoiled ballots in the last election, in 2013, comprised just 1.6 percent of the total. “It is a significant vote of disapproval of this particular election and an act of defiance of the unlawful coercion on voters to go to vote,” Cambodia-based political analyst Lao Mong Hay told Reuters. “A cunning yet legitimate protest against the powerful.” Government spokesman Phay Siphan said the large number of invalid votes showed an anti-election trend. “They are anti-election and the Cambodian People’s Party,” Phay Siphan told Reuters.

John McCain (R-AZ), used her eulogy as a thinly-veiled way to criticize Trump and his “cheap rhetoric” while boasting about her father’s life. “The real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who lived lives of comfort and privilege,” Meghan told a packed audience at the Washington National Cathedral in Washington, DC, Saturday.

In a guest column published Friday, the Arizona Republican called for the Senate to return to regular order as it grapples with issues such as health care, immigration, tax reform and infrastructure spending, saying it's more important than ever given that Trump \"has no experience of public office, is often poorly informed and can be impulsive in his speech and conduct.\" McCain makes the point that the U.S. system of government, \"with its checks and balances, its bicameral Congress, its protections of the rights of the minority,\" was created to facilitate compromise, not speed. \"It requires pragmatic problem-solving from even the most passionate partisans. It relies on compromise between opposing sides to protect the interests we share,\" McCain wrote in the Post. \"We can fight like hell for our ideas to prevail. But we have to respect each other or at least respect the fact that we need each other. \"That has never been truer than today, when Congress must govern with a president who has no experience of public office, is often poorly informed and can be impulsive in his speech and conduct,\" McCain continued. \"We must respect his authority and constitutional responsibilities. We must, where we can, cooperate with him. But we are not his subordinates. We don’t answer to him. We answer to the American people. We must be diligent in discharging our responsibility to serve as a check on his power. And we should value our identity as members of Congress more than our partisan affiliation.\" Frustrated by the highly partisan process in which legislation was crafted behind closed doors during the fight to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, McCain joined with two other Republican senators and all of the chamber's Democrats to shoot down controversial GOP health care legislation. McCain's July 28 vote against the Republican \"skinny repeal\" plan essentially doomed GOP efforts to undo Obamacare, at least in the short term. His vote remains a raw point with Trump, who took a swing at McCain during a recent news conference and ripped him again, though not by name, during his Aug. 22 Phoenix rally.

{"global_context": "British lawmakers will vote on leaving the European Union without a deal a day after the crushing defeat of Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal agreement. If you're catching up this morning after the crushing 149-vote defeat of Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal deal, we've got you covered. Here are some key Brexit questions answered: Is Brexit going away Nice try! No. Brexit is happening on March 29 unless the UK applies for an extension to Article 50. That vote is probably going to take place on Thursday. The EU Council meets next week (March 21) that's likely to be May's nearest chance to apply for such an extension. Could the EU kick the UK out? Short answer yes, but why would they? If the EU wanted a no-deal crash-out, they only need to wait another 17 days. Can the EU laugh and say no, when/if the UK asks for more time? I doubt they would laugh – eurocrats are not famed for their sense of humor (apart from Donald Tusk) – but with a heavy heart, the leaders of the EU 27 members states could decline the UK's request for an extension to Article 50. It only takes one member state to veto the extension and many of them have good reason for doing so. The EU has been consistent that if the UK asks for an extension with sensible suggestions as to how they can get out of this trench, it would be carefully considered. But EU diplomats have also made clear for months that they see no point in delaying, only to end up back where we are now. Is Theresa May going to resign? History says no, at least in the immediate future. May has an extraordinary ability to cling on to power. With an EU summit days away and Brexit far from sorted, May is, whatever you think of her, a dedicated public servant. It's hard to see how she would see it's in the best interests of the UK to suddenly create uncertainty around the leadership of the country, on top of everything else. What about another referendum? Right now, the clearest path to a second Brexit vote is if the opposition Labour Party puts forward an amendment that a majority of the House of Commons backs. Labour recently adopted a formal policy of backing a second public vote on Brexit, should their alternative plan to May's be defeated in a Commons vote, which was the case last month. But people hoping to see Brexit canceled should keep the champagne corked for the time being. Labour hasn't tabled any such amendment to date, and there's a pretty good reason for that: they don't think it will pass. The risk of losing that vote is too great to play around with and would both undermine the authority of the opposition and exacerbate divisions within the party. Yes, it's not just May's Conservatives that have problems... The other reason Remainers should hold off the celebrations is this: it's unclear whether, even if a second public vote were to be held, Remain would be on the ballot. Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the Labour Party, has been careful not to endorse the so-called \"People's Vote\" campaign and instead always words his second referendum plan as a second public vote. What about another election? Now you're talking. Some think that Labour only backed a second vote because of its ultimate desire to force an early general election – something the party believes it could win. Labour saw success in the 2017 snap election by having a Schrodinger's Brexit policy – appearing more europhile than the Conservatives while officially supporting leaving the EU. Formally backing a second referendum has a similar effect, especially if the government continually blocks the possibility of it happening. And if you think this sounds far-fetched, Labour aides were on Tuesday celebrating the fact that the Commons Speaker John Bercow didn't accept any amendments. Is the threat that Brexit can be lost real? The sight of May and President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker sitting side-by-side on Monday night, claiming it was this deal or no Brexit, was nothing short of extraordinary. Both know that this isn't really true. The only way Brexit can be lost is if the UK revokes Article 50. It would need to pass an Act of Parliament to do so, which without a public vote instructing parliament to do so is a total non-starter. It could happen, but it would require first a Brexit delay, then a national vote with a huge majority.

{"global_context": "President Donald Trump fired back Wednesday morning against claims made by outspoken basketball dad LaVar Ball. President Trump escalated his Twitter war with basketball patriarch LaVar Ball, calling him \"a poor man's Don King\" and an \"ungrateful fool.\" The Wednesday morning tweet blitz came as the two continued to feud over Trump's role in securing the release of one of Ball's three sons after he was detained in China, where the UCLA basketball player was held for shoplifting while on a tour of the nation. Ball has rebuffed Trump's demands for credit, saying it was Chinese President Xi Jinping who freed his son. “It wasn’t the White House, it wasn’t the State Department, it wasn’t father LaVar’s so-called people on the ground in China that got his son out of a long-term prison sentence - IT WAS ME,” Trump tweeted early Wednesday morning. LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley and Jalen Hill have since returned to the United States, and expressed contrition for swiping Louis Vuitton sunglasses during an outing to Hangzhou. But not so for Ball, who Trump called “just a poor man’s version of Don King, but without the hair. Just think.” “LaVar, you could have spent the next 5 to 10 years during Thanksgiving with your son in China, but no NBA contract to support you. But remember LaVar, shoplifting is NOT a little thing. It’s a really big deal, especially in China. Ungrateful fool!” Trump added in another tweet. The comparison to King was curious, as the legendary boxing promoter is a staunch Republican and Trump supporter whose similarities to Ball are not readily apparent. Ball unleashed a broadside at Trump in a Monday appearance on CNN. “Did (Trump) help the boys get out? I don’t know. If I was going to thank somebody, I probably would thank President Xi. He’s in China. He’s the president of China,” he said. “I helped my son get out of China. I had some people that had boots on the ground that knew the situation.” He also disagreed with Trump who called shoplifting “a very big deal in China,” claiming that he has seen “harsher things” here in the U.S. “I’ve seen 16-, 17-year-old kids that have had to go to jail for life, that were my friends,” Ball said. “He wasn’t physical. He returned it. He fessed up to it.” The Ball-Trump feud has been continuing since last week, reaching a peak on Sunday when Trump suggested on Twitter that the three basketball players should have been left in jail because Ball “is unaccepting of what I did for his son” and “very ungrateful!” after he refused to thank him.

But he had a deeply resonant story to tell them, having successfully prosecuted two white Klansmen for their roles in the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham that killed four African-American girls. As Mr. Moore was hobbled by allegations that he had engaged in inappropriate relations with teenage girls while in his 30s, Mr. Jones’s campaign coffers grew fat, and in late November his campaign manager said the team would try to make contact — by mail, phone or otherwise — with every likely black voter five or six times before Election Day. Video The campaign and its allies looked for ways to reach out to black voters without stirring up white Republicans. Mr. Jones toured black churches in Selma with Representative Terri Sewell, an African-American congresswoman. Other high-profile black supporters made appearances on his behalf, including Representative John Lewis of Georgia and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey. Toward the end of the campaign, Mr. Obama recorded a robocall for Mr. Jones, and the former basketball star Charles Barkley, an Alabama native, urged voters to reject Mr. Moore at a campaign event on Monday. “We’ve got to, at some point, we got to stop looking like idiots to the nation,” Mr. Barkley said. Michael Nabors, 54, and his wife, Ella, 55, were among the black voters soaking up the Democratic good cheer after news agencies called the race for Mr. Jones. “We knew the world was looking at us,” he said. Mr. Nabors said that black voters were paying attention to Mr. Moore’s comments in September, in which he said that America was last “great” during the days when slavery was legal. He said they paid attention when Mr. Moore brought Stephen K. Bannon, the former Trump adviser, to campaign for him. He said that they paid attention to the allegations brought by the women who said Mr. Moore had consorted with them when they were young.

{"global_context": "Glenview trustee candidate Benjamin Polony, 19, said Wednesday he is confident his nominating petitions will withstand the scrutiny after an objection was filed against them. A village Electoral Board hearing was convened Wednesday at Glenview Village Hall to hear the challenge. “This is some attempt by an opposing party to try to scare me off the ballot,” Polony said after opening arguments in the village Electoral Board’s review. “They probably see me as an easy target because I’m 19. They got that wrong. I’m ready to fight this and win and win the election.” The Electoral Board, comprised of Village President James Patterson, Village Clerk Matthew Formica and Trustee Deborah Karton, moved to continue the hearing until the Cook County Clerk’s Office can schedule a time to inspect Polony’s petitions. Polony is seeking one of three trustee seats open in the April 2 election. He is running against two slates of three candidates each. Mary Cooper, Chuck Gitles and incumbent Michael Jenny were endorsed by the Citizens for Glenview. Tom Greenhaw, Dia Morgan and Cathy Wilson are running as part of the Better Government in Glenview Party. Glenview residents Elizabeth Brown, Kathleen Gazda, Judith Traynor and William Traynor, none of whom are seeking village office in the April municipal election, have filed multiple objections to Polony’s petitions, said Mary Ryan Norwell, an attorney representing the four in the case. Polony’s petitions contain signatures of people who are not registered to vote at the addresses on the petitions, fraudulent signatures, signatures of people who live outside Glenview, missing or incomplete addresses, and people who signed more than once, Norwell said. “Because of these irregularities and insufficiencies, we believe the nominating papers contain fewer than the minimum number of signatures as required by election code,” she said. “We’re asking that the candidate’s name be stricken and not appear on the ballot in the April election.” Polony’s father, Richard Polony, who is representing him in the case, said many of the signatures were collected at Glenview Village Hall from Glenview residents who had just voted in the November election. “We were surprised to see objections to individuals who had just voted in the election,” Richard Polony said. “To say those signatures were not registered voters or were forgeries was a surprise. Some of those individuals were our own neighbors. We know them personally and yet their signatures were objected to.” Polony said once the petitions are reviewed, the board will find that the objections are “not well founded.” Attorneys for both sides agreed to follow the board’s proposed rules for the hearing after some discussion of the delay in notifying Benjamin Polony of Wednesday’s hearing. He agreed to waive any objection to the fact that he had not yet received formal notification of the hearing even as it began Wednesday. Benjamin Polony said he learned of the hearing time and date from a newspaper reporter. Board attorney Eric Patt said the board carefully followed Illinois law in notifying both parties of the case via certified mail sent Saturday, Dec. 29, but slow mail service during the New Year’s Day holiday weekend likely caused the delay in notification.

{"global_context": "Boris Johnson just gave the best and most important speech of his life: the one that might, with luck, save Brexit. Former UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson just gave the best and most important speech of his life: the one that might, with luck, save Brexit. It definitely wasn’t his funniest speech or the most fluent. Boris actually referred to notes which, as an experienced debater and master of the off-the-cuff quip, he almost never does. But then he has never made a speech quite like this important before. At stake, as he addressed the Commons, were not just a lifetime’s personal ambitions but also the future of Britain and the credibility of democracy itself. Just to recap, in June 2016, the people of Britain were offered a choice: whether to Remain in the European Union or whether to Leave. By a significant majority, they voted Leave. But now — despite official assurances given beforehand that the referendum vote would be honoured — the political class and its fellow travellers in big business, in the City, in the law firms, in academe, in the media and, of course, in the rampantly pro-Remain civil service have conspired to frustrate that expression of the democratic will. So this was the purpose of Boris’s speech: to try to hold Prime Minister Theresa May true to the promise she made to the British people that “Brexit means Brexit”. He did so by comparing, unfavourably, the commitments May made to Brexit in a speech in January this year at Lancaster House with the watered-down, surrender-monkey sell-out which she tried imposing on her cabinet in Chequers last weekend. Here is one of the key moments: So, Mr Speaker, after 18 months of stealthy retreat we have come from the bright certainties of Lancaster House to the Chequers agreement Put them side by side Lancaster House said laws will be once again “made in Westminster” Chequers says there will be “ongoing harmonisation” with a common EU rulebook Lancaster House said it would be wrong to “comply with EU rules and regulations without having a vote on what those rules and regulations are” Chequers now makes us rule takers Lancaster House said we don’t want anything that leaves us “half-in, half-out” and that “we do not seek to hold on to bits of membership as we leave” Chequers says that we will remain in lockstep on goods and agrifoods and much more besides with disputes ultimately adjudicated by the ECJ Far from making laws in Westminster, there are large sectors in which ministers will have no power to initiate, innovate or even deviate After decades in which UK ministers have gone to Brussels and expostulated against costly EU regulation we are now claiming that we must accept every jot and tittle for our economic health – and with no say of our own and no way of protecting our businesses and entrepreneurs from rules that may be not in their interests. Armchair experts often say that Boris Johnson is unsuitable to be Prime Minister. They doubt whether his heart was ever in Brexit. They say he is insufficiently serious. I say: this is the kind of thing people used to say about Donald Trump – before he went on to become one of the greatest and most effective ever U.S. Presidents. Johnson is just one of several strong potential candidates to replace Theresa May. What differentiates him from most of the others is that he has stopped playing politics, got off the fence, and committed himself. The Brexit that Boris Johnson very explicitly wants is also what the vast majority of the British people want. Right now, Boris Johnson is Britain’s best hope of a bright, independent, free-trading future outside the clutches of the European Union. And I’m not the only one who thinks so….

{"global_context": "People hoping for the impeachment of President Donald Trump will take to the streets Saturday, June 15, sending a message that could be heard in Congress. More than 140 rallies are planned across the country, including several in Southern California, under the banner “#ImpeachTrump: Act to Defend Democracy.” The event is described by supporters as a national day of action demanding that House Democrats start impeachment proceedings against Trump. It’s unclear how many people will turn out. In 2017 and 2018, several issues — the Muslim ban, gun control, violence against women — sparked millions of people to take to the streets. But nothing similar has taken place since the 2018 midterm election, when Democrats won victories to take control of the House of Representatives and many state legislatures around the country. Also, calls for Trump’s formal ouster aren’t new. At least one impeachment rally has been held in Southern California in each of the past two years. But the national debate over whether or not the House should begin an impeachment inquiry ramped up earlier this year, following the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the investigation into Russian interference in the November 2016 election. While Mueller said there was not enough evidence to establish an illegal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, he did say the Trump campaign was willing to accept Russia’s help and he did not exonerate the president on the crime of obstruction. “The… American people have seen that there is enough evidence to begin the impeachment process of Trump, based on what he’s said in public and also what’s in the redacted Mueller report,” said Aaron McCall, chairman of Indivisible OC48, which is organizing impeachment events in Seal Beach and Laguna Beach. “This is now a rule of law question,” McCall said. “It’s about whether or not we’re going to stand up for what’s right.” Though there isn’t a similar organized effort from those who don’t want impeachment, at least some Trump supporters don’t believe the events on Saturday will lead to action. “Everything they have done to impeach Trump has blown up in their faces,” said John Berry, spokesman for the conservative group, Redlands Tea Party Patriots. “It’s to the point where it’s just comical,” Berry added. “Let them do what they want, because middle America is just laughing, not with them, but at them.” Though some Democratic candidates for president have spoke in favor of impeachment, most Americans are not yet on board. A poll conducted June 6-10 by Quinnipiac University found 33% of Americans in favor of impeachment, 61% against the idea, and 6% unsure. The poll, which has a 3.5% margin of error, was conducted before June 12, when Trump told ABC News that he would accept politically helpful information from a foreign power in the future, and suggested he might not tell the FBI about the offer. Impeachment would begin with an inquiry in the House, where Democrats now hold a 37-seat majority. If, following that inquiry, impeachment was recommended, a trial and vote on the issue would take place in the Senate, where the GOP has a six-seat advantage. Even if the Senate is unlikely to vote to remove the president, supporters of impeachment believe the House could formally rebuke Trump. “I think it’s a very important, for the democratic process, for citizens to send a message to their representatives,” McCall said. “While, in Congress, there are some who are a bit on the fence about whether or not we should take action, we the people of the 48th believe we should,” he added. “So we’re trying to send that message.” Nearly two dozen organizations are supporting the effort, such as Indivisible, MoveOn and By The People. Events are planned in Riverside, Palm Springs, Temecula, Chino Hills, Mission Viejo, Irvine, Brea, Long Beach, Pasadena, Los Angeles and Thousand Oaks, among others listed on www.impeach.org. Candy Soares, organizer of the rally in Chino Hills, said she’s not deterred by what’s expected to be blistering midday heat. “The safety and security of our country is more important than being a little warm for a couple of hours. There’s so much going on in our country that is unseemly, if not illegal,” she said. “Our country is in danger and we’re doing everything we can to bring attention to that.” Staff writer Beau Yarbrough contributed to this report.

He said Trump would urge countries with the most influence over Pyongyang to “convince its leaders that the pursuit of nuclear weapons is a dead end” and that it must denuclearize. “And he will remind friend and foe alike that the United States stands ready to defend itself and our allies using the full range of our capabilities,” said McMaster. Perhaps Trump’s most critical stop will be in China, where he will ask Chinese President Xi Jinping to do more to rein in North Korea. Senior U.S. officials say China considers North Korea a strategic asset and is reluctant to cut off resources to Pyongyang for fear of triggering a refugee wave. McMaster said Trump, who has approved a variety of sanctions against North Korea while pressing China to do more, is at the beginning of his drive for Pyongyang to give up nuclear weapons. Trump has warned he would “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatened the United States. “I think we have to be a little patient here for at least a few months to see what more we and others can do, including China,” said McMaster. “I don’t think we need to reassess our strategy now. I think we have to give it a couple of months, a few months, and then see what adjustments we might need to make.” Trump is expected to press Xi to reduce oil exports to North Korea to China, coal imports from Pyongyang and limit financial transactions. The Chinese leader is newly ascendant after consolidating power at a Communist Party congress.

{"global_context": "The president goes on a tweetstorm in response to New York Times report of a Russia-related FBI investigation of Trump last year. CLOSE President Donald Trump is claiming that no American president has been as \"tough\" on Russia as he has been, amid ongoing criticism of his Helsinki summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. (July 18) AP President Donald Trump, in response to reports that the FBI began an investigation of him last year to find out whether he had a clandestine agenda to help Russia, said Saturday that former FBI director James Comey and other \"losers\" at the bureau \"tried to do a number on your President.\" He called Comey a \"total sleaze\" and \"crooked cop\" and took swipes at special counsel Robert Mueller and the New York Times, which broke the story Friday night. \"My firing of James Comey was a great day for America,\" he tweeted. The newspaper said the decision to investigate Trump himself was an aggressive move by FBI officials confronting the chaotic aftermath of the firing of Comey and enduring the president’s verbal assaults on the Russia investigation as a “witch hunt.” CNN reported that counterintelligence agents were investigating why Trump was acting in ways that seemed to benefit Russia. Both news organizations said Trump's firing of Comey was a major factor prompting the FBI to take action. Donald Trump (Photo: JIM WATSON, AFP/Getty Images) Although the report was published Friday night and prompted a sharp response from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, Trump did not weigh in until 7:05 a.m Saturday. \"Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin’ James Comey, a total sleaze! In a series of tweets, he said the FBI was in \"complete turmoil\" at the time because of Comey's \"poor leadership\" and his handling of an investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. \"My firing of James Comey was a great day for America,\" Trump tweeted. \"He was a Crooked Cop...........who is being totally protected by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats...\" He singled out several FBI agents in his five-part tweetstorm. \"Lyin’ James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter S and his lover, agent Lisa Page, & more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President,\" he tweeted. \"Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the 'insurance policy?' This is it!\" Trump was referring to charges that some FBI agents, among them McCabe, Peter Strzok and Page, a colleague he was intimately involved with, were part of a conspiracy to undermine the president. Addressing the Russia aspect of the Times report, Trump said he had been \"FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President.\" Lyin’ James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter S and his lover, agent Lisa Page, & more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President. Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the “insurance policy?” This is it! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 12, 2019 He repeated his long held contention that \"getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing.\" Sanders said in her statement Friday night that Comey was fired for just cause and that Trump has never favored Russia. “This is absurd. James Comey was fired because he’s a disgraced partisan hack, and his Deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI. Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia.” The obstruction probe was an idea the FBI had previously considered, but it didn't start until Comey was fired, CNN reported. The justification went beyond Trump's firing of Comey, CNN said, according to its sources, and included the president's conversation with Comey in the Oval Office asking him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Trump insisted last year that he didn't fire FBI Director James Comey because of the Russia investigation, despite video and documentary evidence to the contrary, including a key interview with NBC's Lester Holt. \"Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia!\" Trump tweeted shortly after the firing. \"The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!\" The FBI director's firing is central to an obstruction of justice investigation being conducted by Mueller, who is also looking into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election in order to help Trump.

{"global_context": "Conservative activists, GOP lawmakers and Trump tweets have amplified allegations that the Russia investigation is biased. Tom Fitton, president of the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, said “our concerns about Mueller are beginning to take hold.” (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post) For months, efforts to discredit special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign flickered at the fringes of political debate. Now, the allegation that FBI and Justice Department officials are part of a broad conspiracy against President Trump is suddenly center stage, amplified by conservative activists, GOP lawmakers, right-leaning media and the president himself. The clamor has become a sustained backdrop to the special counsel investigation, with congressional committees grilling a parade of law enforcement officials in recent days. “Until recently, it has been a lonely battle,” said Tom Fitton, whose conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch has helped drive the charges by unearthing internal Justice Department documents. “Our concerns about Mueller are beginning to take hold.” The partisan atmosphere is a sharp departure from the near-universal support that greeted Mueller’s selection as special counsel in May — and threatens to shadow his investigation’s eventual findings. Trump, while vowing to cooperate with the special counsel, has also encouraged attacks on Mueller’s credibility, tweeting that the investigation is “the greatest Witch Hunt in U.S. political history.” The controversy, percolating for months, escalated dramatically in early December with the revelation of text messages in which one of Mueller’s former top investigators, Peter Strzok, called Trump an “idiot” last year and predicted Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton would win the election in a landslide. Special counsel Robert S. Mueller departs the U.S. Capitol after a closed-door meeting with members of the Senate Judiciary Committee in June. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP) As the deputy head of counterintelligence at the FBI, Strzok played a critical role in both the Clinton email investigation last year and the Russia probe before he was removed by Mueller this summer. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who met with Fitton earlier this year and has for months alleged that the FBI was working against Trump’s election, said in an interview that many of his Republican colleagues now share his view that there has been an orchestrated effort against Trump. “I’ve had all kinds of Republicans come up to me and say, ‘This is unbelievable, it looks like the FBI was trying to put its finger on the scale here,’ ” Jordan said. [Trump team’s meeting with Mueller’s office poised to ratchet up tensions] Among current and former law enforcement officials, the public attacks on the FBI are seen as an indirect way of trying to discredit Mueller and blunt future findings he may issue, a view shared by many Democratic lawmakers. “There is a concerted push from the White House . . . and their allies to bring the investigations to a halt,” Rep. Adam B. Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in an interview. “They are also trying to attack Mueller’s credibility and the credibility of the FBI, so that whatever Mueller finds can be rejected . . . as a fake.” “The White House would like to have the best of both worlds,” he added. “They make the public case that they are cooperating, while their allies do the dirty work.” In response, Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer overseeing the response to the Russia investigation, said in a statement that “the President respects the Special Counsel and his process and will continue to fully cooperate with the Special Counsel.” A spokesman for Mueller declined to comment. Some of the key players in the campaign against the special counsel probe are veterans of politically charged investigations, having helped drive attacks against the Clintons in the 1990s and during last year’s presidential campaign. One leading critic is David Bossie, a former Trump deputy campaign manager. He was a congressional investigator who examined President Bill Clinton’s campaign finances in the late 1990s and currently leads Citizens United, a conservative advocacy group that produced movies critical of Hillary Clinton and other Democrats. Bossie now makes frequent appearances on Fox News and other conservative media outlets, arguing that the special counsel is being used to try to delegitimize Trump. He said it is crucial to make a sustained fight against the probe. “It is not that I wake up and say, ‘How do I match the Clinton playbook?’ ” Bossie said. “I just have the experience of understanding the rapid-response aspect of messaging. You have to be out there with a counter, set-the-facts-straight message or highlight what the problems are very quickly, or these things get away from you.” He argues there is no evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. “I’m not against Mueller; I’m against the concept of an investigation as a red herring,” he said. Fitton’s Judicial Watch group, too, has a long history of investigating the Clintons, having filed numerous lawsuits against the administration of President Bill Clinton. During the 2016 campaign, the organization obtained thousands of emails written by Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state. This year, Judicial Watch has helped stoke the attacks against the Mueller probe with material it obtained through lawsuits and Freedom of Information Act requests. The nonprofit group, which has a $35 million budget and 50 employees, does not release the names of its roughly 500,000 donors, Fitton said. Fitton has frequently gone on Fox News, conservative websites and Twitter to report his findings. On Dec. 2, after Fitton tweeted that Trump “needs to clean house at FBI/DOJ,” Trump retweeted another user’s summary of Fitton’s statement. In one email obtained through a Judicial Watch lawsuit, Andrew Weissmann, a senior lawyer working for Mueller, wrote in January that he was “so proud” of then-acting attorney general Sally Yates’s decision to defy Trump’s executive order banning travel by certain immigrants. The FOIA request was filed in May and was received in the fall, Fitton said. Other requests have taken longer or been rejected all together, he said. [Trump calls conduct at the FBI ‘disgraceful’ in latest criticism of bureau] Judicial Watch also obtained emails regarding FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe that the group says shows he was involved in helping his wife, Jill, run as a Democratic candidate for a state Senate seat in Virginia. McCabe was told in one email that then-Director James B. Comey had “no issue” with McCabe’s wife seeking the seat. Another document said Clinton attended a June 2015 fundraiser for Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s political action committee, which in turn gave nearly $500,000 to Jill McCabe for her state Senate bid. Republicans have also raised questions about the FBI’s handling of a dossier produced by Christopher Steele, a former British spy who was hired by a research firm called Fusion GPS to investigate Trump’s ties to Russia. Senate Intelligence Committee investigators on Thursday interviewed Bruce Ohr, a Justice Department official whose wife, Nellie, worked for Fusion GPS in 2016. In a recent court filing, Fusion GPS said it was being targeted by congressional committees “coordinating with the President [and] his personal lawyers . . . to misdirect attention to Fusion . . . due to their perceived role in exposing the ties between the Trump campaign and the Russians.” Jay Sekulow, one of Trump’s outside attorneys, has called for a second special counsel to be appointed to investigate the Fusion GPS matter. He said in an interview that his proposal “is in no way related to Robert Mueller,” with whom he said he has “a professional and cooperative relationship.” The pressure on Mueller’s team has increased as prosecutors unveiled charges this fall against four former Trump advisers. Less than two weeks after former national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, the Justice Department disclosed anti-Trump and pro-Clinton texts that Strzok exchanged with another senior FBI official, Lisa Page, while they were having an affair and overseeing sensitive political investigations of those candidates. The texts were uncovered in July by the Justice Department’s inspector general, which has been investigating FBI decision-making during the probe into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. When the IG warned Mueller in the summer about what the probe had found, Mueller immediately removed Strzok from his team. Strzok was reassigned to a job in the FBI’s human resources division. Page had also worked on the Mueller team, but left two weeks earlier for what officials said were unrelated reasons. The Post has reported that in a 2015 text, Strzok said that Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), who sought the Democratic nomination against Clinton, was “an idiot like Trump. Figure they cancel each other out.’’ In 2016 texts, Strzok wrote, “God, Hillary should win 100,000,000-0” and that he was “worried about what happens if [Clinton] is elected.” Former colleagues defended him, saying Strzok’s personal opinions had no impact on how he conducted investigations. “To think Pete could not do his job objectively shows no understanding of the organization,” said Michael Steinbach, former executive assistant director of the FBI’s National Security Branch, adding: “We have Democrats, we have Republicans, we have conservatives and liberals. . . . Having personal views doesn’t prevent us from independently following the facts.” But as news of Strzok’s text messages spread, Trump jumped on the story, tweeting: “Report: ‘ANTI-TRUMP FBI AGENT LED CLINTON EMAIL PROBE’ Now it all starts to make sense!” Republicans in Congress took the cue, seizing upon the texts to attack the credibility of the FBI and the Mueller investigation. “The senior levels of the FBI have been infected with an intractable bias that seemed to favor Hillary Clinton and work against President Donald Trump,” said Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida on Fox News on Wednesday, adding, “It’s time for Bob Mueller to put up or shut up: If there’s evidence of collusion, let’s see it.” The calls for Mueller’s ouster are strongest in the House, where a group of Republicans have been calling for the special counsel to resign. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan has said Mueller’s investigation should proceed without interference. But he has allowed several committee investigations that are calling into question the integrity of the probe. “The House has a constitutional obligation to exercise congressional oversight, and the speaker is supportive of our committee chairmen carrying out their work,” said Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong. In recent days, for example, three House committees grilled McCabe over his participation in the FBI’s Russia investigation and his role in the FBI examination into Clinton’s use of a private email server. Democrats called it a thinly veiled attempt to weaken McCabe and slow down Mueller’s probe. McCabe plans to retire in a few months when he becomes fully eligible for pension benefits, people familiar with the matter told The Post. “Those people should be investigating the real crime, which is Russia’s interference in our democracy, and instead they’re being hauled before a six-hour series of interviews,” said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.). At the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) and a small group of Republican lawmakers are discussing writing a report next year that would highlight alleged “corruption” at the FBI, according to people familiar with the plans. Such a report would focus on information about the conduct of FBI officials in the course of the Russia investigation, those people said. On the Senate side, one of the loudest voices has been Republican Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, who chairs the Judiciary Committee and has raised questions about the impartiality of Mueller’s probe. He has called for McCabe to be fired and shown a willingness to dig into Mueller’s past tenure as FBI director, complaining Thursday that the FBI and DOJ have been too slow to rout out people peddling “political influence.” Grassley has also called for a second special counsel to look at decisions the FBI and DOJ made at the time that the Obama administration approved a uranium deal giving Russia a significant stake in the U.S. market. The inquiry would bring de facto scrutiny on Mueller, who was FBI director at the time. Grassley said that his staff is in touch with Nunes’s staff, though he would not specify exactly what elements of their committees’ parallel inquiries they were communicating about. “I wouldn’t want to say there’s coordination,” Grassley said. “There’s communication.” He insisted that he was not aiming to discredit Mueller, adding that he has “got confidence [Mueller]’s going to be able to do what he’s doing.” Trump, meanwhile, has continued to urge on the questions. This month, he tweeted that after the FBI’s “phony and dishonest Clinton investigation (and more) . . . its reputation is in Tatters - worst in History! But fear not, we will bring it back to greatness.” Tom Hamburger and Alice Crites contributed to this report.

But, he added, “we also have a moral duty. I pushed forward in the last Knesset a recognition of the Armenian Holocaust even though this is not the right practical move opposite the Turks. Because there is a point where you say enough is enough.” He was far more careful when I turned to the subject of Donald Trump. “I am, like any other Israeli, thankful for President Trump. I sat at the opening of the embassy in Jerusalem with tears in my eyes,” he said. What of Mr. Trump’s recent flurry of statements about how the Democratic Party has become anti-Israel and anti-Jewish? “I’m going to say this as politely as I can,” Mr. Lapid said. “He was wrong. I don’t think you can say that Eliot Engel and Jerry Nadler and Ted Deutch and Chuck Schumer don’t like Israel. They are the most pro-Israel people I know.” Mr. Lapid said one of his priorities if he wins would be to rebuild support for Israel among progressives. “Israel must be a bipartisan issue,” he said. One of the casualties of Israel becoming an increasingly partisan issue has been American Jews themselves, who vote overwhelmingly Democratic and who see Israel’s rightward turn as betraying fundamental liberal values. In other words, American Jews find themselves stuck between BDS — the boycott movement against Israel — and Bibi. “I understand the fact that some kind of gap was opened between Israel and the diaspora,” Mr. Lapid said of this problem. “I think what unites us — culturally, morally — is way bigger than what separates us. And what we need to go back to is this vocabulary of one people.” It is when Mr. Lapid talks about Jewish values and Jewish history that he is the most compelling. Doubly so when it comes to the subject of his father, Tommy Lapid, a Holocaust survivor who built a life in Israel as a journalist and then as a politician, and died in 2008. “My father had a friend in the Budapest ghetto. His name was Thomas Lantos,” Mr. Lapid said. “After the Holocaust, they went to the same pier in the same harbor and Tom took a boat and went left and my dad took a boat and went right.” Mr. Lantos eventually ended up in California, where he became a Democratic member of the House of Representatives and head of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “They always felt that if they took the opposite boat, Tom would be the minister of justice and my father would be the head of the foreign committee.”.

{"global_context": "The secretary of state seemed off-script while briefing reporters after Trump had spoken earlier in the day. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson holds a news briefing Wednesday on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York. (Amr Alfiky/Reuters) NEW YORK — With a chatty boss like President Trump, message discipline has not exactly been scrupulously attended within his administration. Especially by the boss himself. So when Secretary of State Rex Tillerson briefed reporters here Wednesday night following a private meeting with Iranian officials on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, he declared that Trump was \"still considering\" whether to decertify Iran over violations of the U.N.-backed nuclear deal ahead of a deadline next month. A reporter quickly corrected Tillerson: Trump actually had said publicly just hours earlier that he had made up his mind. \"I have decided,\" the president said. \"I'll let you know.\" Tillerson looked sheepish. Okay, he acknowledged, the president had indeed said as much \"I think in a 'press avail' or a spray somewhere.\" (A spray, in White House parlance, is akin to a photo-op in which the president occasionally makes brief remarks or answers shouted questions from reporters, which is what happened in Trump's case.) \"I didn't know he was going to say today he made a decision,\" Tillerson said. The nation's top diplomat then went on to add: \"I knew he had, but I didn’t know he was going to say he had.\" Got that? Trump has a long history of undermining or contradicting what his underlings, including press secretaries and Cabinet secretaries, say in public, often within hours. That can make the administration appear chaotic and disorganized; Tillerson, in particular, has suffered from the public impression that, while he has worked hard to develop a personal relationship with Trump, he remains outside the inner circle when it comes to decision-making. Even foreign leaders have trouble, at times, figuring out what the president and his team are doing or saying. For Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May, the answer to this dilemma Wednesday was to go to Trump himself. Tillerson said she asked Trump if he would share his decision with her. \"He said no,\" Tillerson said. \"So, I think, as the president always indicated, he will let you know when he thinks it’s useful to let you know, and he doesn’t share his forward planning with people.” Including, in some cases, Tillerson himself.

{"global_context": "Russia's president said if Sergei Skripal and his daughter had been poisoned by a Soviet-designed nerve agent, they would have died instantly. CLOSE Russia on Saturday announced it is expelling 23 British diplomats and threatened further measures in retaliation in a growing diplomatic dispute over a nerve agent attack on a former spy in Britain. (March 17) AP Russian President Vladimir Putin addresses a crowd in Moscow on March 18, 2018. (Photo: ALEXANDER ZEMLIANICHENKO, AFP/Getty Images) MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday dismissed British accusations of Russia’s involvement in an ex-spy’s poisoning as “nonsense,” but added that Moscow is ready to cooperate with London in the investigation. In his first comments on the incident, Putin referred to the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter as a “tragedy,” but added that if the British claim that they were poisoned by the Soviet-designed nerve agent were true, the victims would have been killed instantly. Skripal, a former Russian intelligence officer convicted in his home country of spying for Britain, and his daughter have remained in critical condition following the March 4 poisoning. “It’s quite obvious that if it were a military-grade nerve agent, people would have died on the spot,” he said. “Russia doesn’t have such means. We have destroyed all our chemical weapons under international oversight unlike some of our partners.” Putin’s comments came a few hours after British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said he has evidence that Russia has been stockpiling a nerve agent in violation of international law “very likely for the purposes of assassination.” Johnson said the trail of blame for the poisoning of Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the English city of Salisbury “leads inexorably to the Kremlin.” Johnson told reporters that Britain has information that within the last 10 years, “the Russian state has been engaged in investigating the delivery of such agents, Novichok agents … very likely for the purposes of assassination.” He said “they have been producing and stockpiling Novichok, contrary to what they have been saying.” Putin dismissed the British accusations, emphasizing that an attack on Skripal would make no sense. “Any reasonable man would understand that it’s just sheer nonsense, complete rubbish to think that anyone in Russia could do anything like that in the run-up to the presidential election and the World Cup,” he said. “It’s simply unthinkable.” At the same time, Putin, who won another six-year term in Sunday’s election, said that Moscow is open for taking part in the probe together with Britain. “We are ready for cooperation. We said it right away,” he said. “We are ready to take part in the investigation, but it’s necessary that the other side shows interest in that too. We haven’t seen that, but we don’t exclude the possibility of joint work.” Johnson said he will brief European Union foreign ministers on the case Monday before meeting with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. He also said officials from the Netherlands-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons would arrive Monday in Britain to take samples of the nerve agent used to poison the Skripals. Police officers in protective suits and masks work near the scene where former double-agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia were discovered after being attacked with a nerve-agent on March 16, 2018 in Salisbury, England. (Photo: Jack Taylor, Getty Images) Britain says it is Novichok, a class of powerful nerve agent developed in the Soviet Union toward the end of the Cold War. Tests to independently verify the British findings are expected to take at least two weeks, Britain’s Foreign Office said. Vladimir Chizhov, Moscow’s EU ambassador, said Russia has no chemical weapons stockpiles and wasn’t behind the poisoning. “Russia had nothing to do with it,” Chizhov told the BBC. Chizhov pointed out that the U.K. chemical weapons research facility, Porton Down, is only eight miles from Salisbury. Asked whether he was saying that Porton Down was responsible, Chizhov replied: “I don’t know.” The British government dismissed the ambassador’s suggestion as “nonsense.” Johnson said it was “not the response of a country that really believed itself to be innocent.” Britain and Russia have each expelled 23 diplomats, broken off high-level contacts and taken other punitive steps in the escalating tit-for-tat dispute, which clouded the run-up to Sunday’s presidential election in Russia. Western powers see the poisoning of the Skripals as the latest sign of increasingly aggressive Russian interference in foreign countries. Johnson said Britain’s National Security Council will meet this week to discuss what further measures the country might take. He said these could include “defending ourselves against cyberattack, (and) looking at any economic measures that could be taken against Russians who corruptly obtained their wealth.” Opposition lawmakers are calling on the British government to clamp down on the illicitly gained money of wealthy Russians in Britain. Critics say U.K. authorities have been slow to investigate the origins of the wealth invested in London’s financial district and property market. The spy dispute has sent U.K.-Russia relations to Cold War-levels of tension. Russia’s ambassador in London, Alexander Yakovenko, called for “cooler heads,” telling the Mail on Sunday that the dispute is “escalating dangerously and out of proportion.” More: Russia expels 23 British diplomats over ex-spy poisoning accusations More: Britain's top diplomat says Russia's Vladimir Putin ordered ex-spy's poisoning More: Ex-double agent poisoned.

{"global_context": "Let's end the lazy thinking and the moral denseness. Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto on Sunday near the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. (Dustin Franz/AFP/Getty Images) Opinion writer President Trump’s defenders and even some of his tepid critics on the right seem determined to keep their moral blinders firmly affixed so as to narrow the discussion about the horrible incidents such as the mass murder at Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. In declaring Trump has “no responsibility” for the horrific murder, they feign or are actually guilty of severe moral and historical cluelessness. No one I know thinks Trump is legally responsible for the deaths of 11 people or that he instructed anyone to commit violent acts. Aside from his remarks during the campaign to the Republican Jewish Coalition, he has steered far from anti-Semitic language (although the administration bizarrely left out “Jews” from its first Holocaust Remembrance Day statement and Trump said the neo-Nazis in Charlottesville included some “fine” people). Nevertheless, those denying any Trump responsibility surely know that is not the point. If no politician’s words, written or spoken, have any effect on anyone, how does one explain hundreds of years of successful propaganda? Politicians, aside from engaging the military or civilian law enforcement, have few tools other than their microphone. And certainly, those trying to skate by with a cramped definition of “responsibility” know this. We elect presidents in large part because they have the bully pulpit and can rally a country, put an issue front and center, change minds and set the contours for acceptable debate. Few would argue that race-baiting leaders in the Jim Crow South had “no responsibility” for racial violence against African Americans. When politicians demonize outsiders (or insinuate their own countrymen are really outsiders), remove social inhibitions against expressing bigotry and dehumanize enemies (and those who they claim assist them), the hate-mongers can hardly be surprised if some fraction of the population takes them seriously. At the same time, we know from history and even contemporary examples how essential it is to rebut and discredit leaders preaching bigotry. We condemn loathsome xenophobia from Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) or the font of anti-Semitic and anti-Israel drivel from Jeremy Corbyn (head of the Labour Party in Britain) because we fear their noxious ideas will take hold and influence others to act. The last people arguing words don’t matter should be self-described conservatives. (This is one reason why I find the “But Gorsuch” excuse for tolerating Trump’s rhetoric morally unsound; of all the things he does, the vile statements he repeats at virtually every public appearance may have the most long-lasting effect on his followers.) They’ve spent decades declaring that politicians’ words influence culture, family structure, crime and just about everything else. It’s bizarre to argue that they have no influence on the most impressionable and least stable people among us. Trump has eradicated red lines of civility, refused to condemn neo-Nazis and offered a steady diet of grotesque stereotypes of immigrants. He has demonized the press and raised fear of foreign terrorists embedded among refugees. His campaign and now his presidency fan the flames of white grievance; he has done more to mainstream nonfactual conspiracies than any president. To say he bears no moral or political responsibility when disturbed or fringe characters hear him, take him seriously, extrapolate from his remarks and engage in horrible acts is willful blindness. He is not solely responsible. He is not mainly responsible. But the guy with the biggest megaphone on the planet is partly responsible when unbalanced people are inspired by his toxic rhetoric and that of followers whom he refuses to repudiate. The uptick in racial violence, anti-Semitic acts and hateful rhetoric that have become omnipresent in the Trump years did not arise out of thin air. (And for now, I’ll leave the absolute refusal to address any reasonable gun laws out of it; but in that, the National Rifle Association and its obedient minions are hardly blameless.) We must all be more specific in identifying names of those who share responsibility for the toxic fumes that violent, unstable people inhale. So here goes. Rupert Murdoch, the executives, on-air talent and shareholders of Fox need to self-reflect. Fox is home to anti-immigrant cranks such as Lou Dobbs and Laura Ingraham. It’s where the caravan is attributed to Jewish billionaire George Soros, where Sean Hannity leads his audience to believe immigrants are especially prone to commit crimes and where Tucker Carlson has adopted the language of white nationalism, decrying diversity in America. Unless and until Fox cleans up its act — drop conspiracies made up out of whole cloth, end demonization and hysteria about immigrants, and stop invoking Soros to explain every political threat (real or imagined) — people of good will should not appear on Fox News, advertise on it or watch it. Instagram and Twitter deserve blame as well. These companies must be much more aggressive in blocking and taking down anti-Semitic, racist and bullying messages and images. There should be zero tolerance for those who traffic in detestable material. Surely logarithms exist to detect the lion’s share of racist and anti-Semitic material — and if not, these hugely successful companies need to hire an army of people to review what’s out there on their platform. Once detected, the material must be removed in a timely fashion and those who post it banned — for life. I’m not calling for a law; I’m calling for those who share responsibility for the pollution of our politics to act responsibly, as if they actually care about the country that allowed them to make billions. Moving on, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and other Republicans should throw out of the GOP caucus Rep. Steve King, who spews anti-immigrant venom and appears with Austrian neo-Nazis. Members can vote to expel him from the House, come to think of it, for conduct unbecoming a congressman. Iowa voters should have voted him out long ago. Their responsibility — voters and GOP leadership — is to remove toxic leaders from positions of power where they can influence others. The greatest moral failure of Ryan’s career will be his spinelessness in the face of insane conspiracies and hateful speech. (“I haven’t seen” the tweet.) In silence, he gave cover to Trump for nonstop lying and detestable language. Republican politicians including Trump and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and right-wing publications and websites must cease using Soros, an anti-Semitic bogeyman, to rile up their base. (For an excellent takedown of the right’s Soros-obsession, read Kevin D. Williamson on the topic.) The GOP and the president should denounce, not celebrate “nationalism” — as that term is now understood. Enough hyping the caravan (which is dwindling and hundreds of miles away) from the White House, on Fox, on right-wing websites and, yes, in the mainstream media. It’s not a threat to America, let alone an immediate threat. And while they have largely stopped doing it, cable TV should not be carrying Trump’s bile-filled campaign speeches live. They can report after the fact on his remarks, pointing out where they depart from reality. In sum, we all have a tendency is to talk about “hate” or “bigotry” as if such sentiments were inanimate objects. We have to root it out. We have to combat it. But there is no “it” — there are people who say, write and do hateful things. And they should be held accountable. Let’s end the lazy thinking and the moral denseness. Lots of people have behaved in ways that degrade our culture and give oxygen and inspiration to dangerous people. We should call them out — by name — and implore them to do better.

{"global_context": "The divided era of politics didn’t start with Trump’s victory. But it has gotten worse under his presidency. On the other side are those who focus on the macro factors in elections. They note that wave elections often sweep out incumbents who objectively had no business losing -- and they see signs that Trump’s unpopularity could be generating such a wave against Republicans. “It feels to me you may well have the potential for that kind of reaction against Trump,” says Greenberg, the Democratic pollster. Those plotting the party’s official strategy at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee are more cautious: They say swing voters still see Trump as such a singular and unconventional figure that it’s not clear they will punish House Republicans even if they have soured on the President. For that reason, Democratic candidates, in their early sparring, are mostly focusing more on linking their Republican rivals to the unpopular GOP congressional leaders than to Trump. And yet whether Democrats buy ads tying Republican House members to Trump or not, and whether those Republicans embrace Trump or keep their distance, history suggests that attitudes toward him will cast a huge, potentially decisive, shadow over next year’s congressional election. According to media exit polls, at least 82% of voters who say they approve of the President’s performance have voted for his party’s House candidates in every midterm election since 1994 (except in 1998, when 77% did.) Over that same period, at least 82% of voters who disapproved of his performance have voted for the other party. Politicians can run from a president of their own party -- but they can’t really hide any longer. That dynamic underscores what may be the safest prediction for 2018. Whether or not Democrats win the 24 seats they need to recapture the House, or, less likely, find the three they need to retake the Senate, the election seems probable to further the parties’ demographic and geographic separation.

{"global_context": "President Donald Trump fired back Wednesday morning against claims made by outspoken basketball dad LaVar Ball. President Trump escalated his Twitter war with basketball patriarch LaVar Ball, calling him \"a poor man's Don King\" and an \"ungrateful fool.\" The Wednesday morning tweet blitz came as the two continued to feud over Trump's role in securing the release of one of Ball's three sons after he was detained in China, where the UCLA basketball player was held for shoplifting while on a tour of the nation. Ball has rebuffed Trump's demands for credit, saying it was Chinese President Xi Jinping who freed his son. “It wasn’t the White House, it wasn’t the State Department, it wasn’t father LaVar’s so-called people on the ground in China that got his son out of a long-term prison sentence - IT WAS ME,” Trump tweeted early Wednesday morning. LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley and Jalen Hill have since returned to the United States, and expressed contrition for swiping Louis Vuitton sunglasses during an outing to Hangzhou. But not so for Ball, who Trump called “just a poor man’s version of Don King, but without the hair. Just think.” “LaVar, you could have spent the next 5 to 10 years during Thanksgiving with your son in China, but no NBA contract to support you. But remember LaVar, shoplifting is NOT a little thing. It’s a really big deal, especially in China. Ungrateful fool!” Trump added in another tweet. The comparison to King was curious, as the legendary boxing promoter is a staunch Republican and Trump supporter whose similarities to Ball are not readily apparent. Ball unleashed a broadside at Trump in a Monday appearance on CNN. “Did (Trump) help the boys get out? I don’t know. If I was going to thank somebody, I probably would thank President Xi. He’s in China. He’s the president of China,” he said. “I helped my son get out of China. I had some people that had boots on the ground that knew the situation.” He also disagreed with Trump who called shoplifting “a very big deal in China,” claiming that he has seen “harsher things” here in the U.S. “I’ve seen 16-, 17-year-old kids that have had to go to jail for life, that were my friends,” Ball said. “He wasn’t physical. He returned it. He fessed up to it.” The Ball-Trump feud has been continuing since last week, reaching a peak on Sunday when Trump suggested on Twitter that the three basketball players should have been left in jail because Ball “is unaccepting of what I did for his son” and “very ungrateful!” after he refused to thank him.

{"global_context": "He now plays down his role overhauling crime laws with segregationist senators in the ’80s and ’90s. That portrayal today is at odds with his actions and rhetoric back then. Mr. Biden apologized in January for portions of his anti-crime legislation, but he has largely tried to play down his involvement, saying in April that he “got stuck with” shepherding the bills because he was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. But an examination of his record — based on newly obtained documents and interviews with nearly two dozen longtime Biden contemporaries in Washington and Delaware — indicates that Mr. Biden’s current characterization of his role is in many ways at odds with his own actions and rhetoric. Mr. Biden arrived in the Senate in 1973 having forged close ties with black constituents but also with law enforcement, and bearing the grievances of the largely white electorate in Delaware. He courted one Southern segregationist senator, James O. Eastland of Mississippi, who helped him land spots on the committee and subcommittees dealing with criminal justice and prisons, and became a close friend and legislative partner of another, Strom Thurmond of South Carolina. While Mr. Biden has said in recent days that he and Mr. Eastland “didn’t agree on much of anything,” it is clear that on a number of important criminal justice issues, they did. As early as 1977, Mr. Biden, with Mr. Eastland’s support, pushed for mandatory minimum sentences that would limit judges’ discretion in sentencing. But perhaps even more consequential was Mr. Biden’s relationship with Mr. Thurmond, who became his co-author on a string of bills that effectively rewrote the nation’s criminal justice laws with an eye toward putting more criminals behind bars. In 1989, with the violent crime rate continuing to rise as it had since the 1970s, Mr. Biden lamented that the Republican president, George H. W. Bush, was not doing enough to put “violent thugs” in prison. In 1993, he warned of “predators on our streets.” And in a 1994 Senate floor speech, he likened himself to another Republican president: “Every time Richard Nixon, when he was running in 1972, would say, ‘Law and order,’ the Democratic match or response was, ‘Law and order with justice’ — whatever that meant.

How does this end?. “If there’s an explosion or fire somewhere, Steve is probably nearby with some matches,” one of Steve Bannon’s former Breitbart News employees once said (admiringly). So it shouldn’t be surprising that Mr. Bannon, who was Donald Trump’s chief strategist, has arrived in Europe.

Image copyright Reuters Many see the election as a referendum on Mr Modi who won a landslide in 2014 Indians will finally find out on Thursday who won the general election after a long and bitter campaign. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stormed to power in 2014, campaigned hard to retain his commanding majority. He was up against the resurgent main opposition Congress party and powerful regional rivals across the country. Exit polls have predicted a win for Mr Modi, but analysts warn they have often been wrong in the past. The last of seven rounds of voting over six weeks ended on Sunday and the counting of the stored ballots begins at 08:00 local time (02.30GMT.) This election is seen as a referendum on Mr Modi, a polarising figure adored by many but also blamed for increasing divisions in India. A party or coalition needs at last 272 seats to secure a majority in the 543-member lower house of parliament, or Lok Sabha. In 2014, the BJP captured 282 seats - the biggest victory by any party in 30 years. The Congress, which won just 44, suffered its worst defeat. This year, there were 900 million voters eligible to take part, making it the largest election the world had ever seen.

Results will be released in phases by the Election Commission - a picture of who is winning could emerge within hours, or it could take longer depending on how close the race is. Final results are not expected until late on Thursday local time, or early Friday. Extra checks matching printed ballots against electronic voting machine results could delay the process. India votes 2019 Who is likely to win? Mr Modi, with his tough image, remains the BJP's main vote-getter. The party and its allies could retain their majority, even if they lose some seats. Critics say promises of stellar economic growth and jobs have not been met, and India has become more polarised along religious lines under his leadership. His main rival is Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who is trying to win over an India weary of his family's dynastic grip on politics. The party's chances of winning a majority appear slim. It also failed to stitch up a pre-vote alliance in crucial states in the east and the south - a sign of its waning influence, analysts say. If neither of the two main parties can win an outright majority, powerful regional parties could play the role of kingmakers in a hung parliament. Image copyright Getty Images Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka must improve on a dismal Congress performance last time A string of exit polls all suggested this outcome was unlikely and predicted a BJP win, but the forecasts were rejected by the opposition. It's often said that whoever wins Uttar Pradesh, wins the Indian election. The huge northern state sends 80 MPs - more than any other - to parliament. In 2014 the BJP won 71 seats there. This time, a repeat performance seems far from certain. In a surprising move, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Samajwadi Party (SP) - bitter rivals - banded together to form a so-called \"grand alliance\" against Mr Modi. Together, they could chip away at the BJP's impressive 2014 seat tally. So the ruling party is hoping to make up for any losses with gains in states such as West Bengal, where it holds just two of the 42 parliamentary seats. Here, the BJP is up against Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee - a contest that produced some of the election's fiercest exchanges.

How do you count hundreds of millions of votes? Electronic voting machines or EVMs have been used in three Indian general elections before this one. They save money and time and results come within hours, rather than the nearly two full days it took when ballots were tallied manually. Each of India's 1.7m EVMs record up to 2,000 votes (the number of registered voters at any given polling booth does not exceed 1,500) and 64 candidates. After being unsealed they are individually inspected by counting staff and agents, overseen by a returning officer.

The EVMs are counted in batches, and results released in phases. The media report the results in real time as they emerge. Final results on the Election Commission website come later. All the machines now have printers producing voter-verifiable paper audit trails to ensure transparency. Authorities will tally the paper trail slips - which are kept in separate sealed boxes - and compare them with the electronic result provided by the machine in at least 5% of polling booths.

The economy is perhaps the biggest issue, with farming in crisis, unemployment on the rise and fears growing that India is heading for a recession. A crop glut and declining commodity prices have led to stagnant farm incomes, leaving many farmers saddled with debt. Under Mr Modi, the world's sixth-largest economy has lost some of its momentum.

But a BBC Freedom of Information request has revealed members of Ms Renou's team carried out the visits without her. Both Sir David and Ms Renou have declined to comment. The Department for Education admitted Ms Renou had not visited the Cumbria academy in person since December 2015. However, it said that members of her official team had carried out 11 visits on her behalf in that time. \"Janet Renou has also been in regular contact with Bright Tribe Trust and Cumbria County Council throughout this period, in addition to meetings with MP Trudy Harrison and a delegation of parents,\" a spokesperson added. 'Agree to differ' In December, Sir David told the education select committee that Ms Renou herself had made three visits to the academy. In response to Copeland Conservative MP Trudy Harrison's claim Ms Renou had not visited in the last two years, he said: \"We can agree to differ on that but I can tell you exactly the dates she and her team have visited the school. \"I know for sure that she and her team visited certainly within two years and, I believe, in 2017.\" Ms Harrison had raised parents concerns about the Bright Tribe Trust, which ran the academy until it pulled out in November last year. The academy is in special measures and has had six head teachers since the trust took over in 2014. Teachers have taken strike action over standards and the \"unsafe\" state of the building. Bright Tribe has said problems stemmed from a lack of investment before it took over.

{"global_context": "The lieutenant governor agreed to remove amendments creating exceptions for rape and incest, leading to anger and arguments on the Senate floor. CLOSE The movement is growing. Wochit, Wochit MONTGOMERY, Ala. – The Alabama Senate fell into chaos Thursday after the lieutenant governor removed from consideration two amendments that created rape and incest exceptions in a bill that would create a near-total ban on abortion. The move by Lt. Gov. Will Ainsworth led to anger from Senate Democrats, who demanded a vote on whether to keep the amendments in, and ultimately led to a delay in the bill itself. The legislation, sponsored by Rep. Terri Collins, a Republican from Decatur, would ban abortion in nearly all cases except when a woman's life is in danger. The Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday approved amendments that would include exceptions for rape and incest – exceptions that Collins rejected during the House debate. The full Senate must approve amendments to include them in a bill. May 6: Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signs fetal heartbeat bill, one of most restrictive abortion laws in nation April 30: Alabama House approves near total ban on abortion Sen. Clyde Chambliss, a Republican from Prattville, who was handling the bill in the Senate, quickly moved to table the amendment, and Ainsworth sustained the motion quickly, as Democrats tried move for a roll call vote. Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton, a Democrat from Greensboro, challenged the ruling that there was a motion, leading to an angry exchange between Singleton and Ainsworth. \"At least treat us fairly and do it the right way,\" said Sen. Vivian Davis Figures, a Democrat from Mobile. \"That's all I ask ... that's all women in this state ask, both Democratic and Republican.\" Lt. Gov. Will Ainsworth in the Alabama Statehouse in Montgomery, Ala., on Tuesday March 12, 2019. (Photo: Mickey Welsh / Advertiser) The move also brought criticism from Republicans, including Senate Judiciary Committee chair Cam Ward, from Alabaster, who threatened to filibuster, saying he supported the bill but added \"I am not going to move (from) here until we get a fair process.\" Other Republicans, including Senate President Pro Tem Del Marsh, from Anniston, said they supported the exceptions for rape and incest. Marsh moved to adjourn shortly after the motion. April 11: Ohio's heartbeat bill could upend Roe v. Wade. It started at a sleepover. April 10: North Dakota becomes third state to ban abortion procedure known as dilation and evacuation The bill would make it a Class A felony, punishable by life in prison or 10 to 99 years, to perform an abortion in the state. Attempting to perform an abortion would be a Class C felony, punishable by 1 to 10 years in prison. The woman having the abortion would not face criminal charges. As passed by the House, Collins’ bill only provided exceptions if the pregnancy threatens the woman’s life; if the woman has a mental illness where birth could result in her death or the death of the child, or if the fetus has a fatal anomaly that would lead to its death after birth. The sponsor says the measure is intended to create a legal challenge to Roe v. Wade, the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision that struck down state bans on abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. Collins argued adding rape and incest exceptions would \"dilute\" the challenge. Follow Brian Lyman on Twitter: @lyman_brian March 21: Mississippi governor signs 'heartbeat' abortion ban into law.

Though Secretary General António Guterres demanded for an immediate ceasefire in Syria on Wednesday, the U.N. Security Council vote was delayed three times by Russia. The final vote was ultimately pushed back from Wednesday to Saturday, and critics claimed that this allowed Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad to continue a days-long bombing campaign that killed hundreds.

{"global_context": "President Donald Trump is due to sign an executive order Thursday morning intended to allow individuals and small businesses to buy a long-disputed type of health insurance that skirts state regulations and Affordable Care Act protections. The White House and allies portray the president's move to expand access to \"association health plans\" as wielding administrative powers to accomplish what congressional Republicans have failed to achieve: tearing down the law's insurance marketplaces and letting some Americans buy skimpier coverage at lower prices. The order will be Trump's biggest step to carry out a broad but ill-defined directive his first night in office for agencies to lessen ACA regulations from the Obama administration. Critics, who include state insurance commissioners, most of the health-insurance industry and mainstream policy specialists, predict that a proliferation of such health plans will have damaging ripple effects: driving up costs for consumers with serious medical conditions and prompting more insurers to flee the law's marketplaces. Part of Trump's actions, they predict, will spark court challenges over their legality. According to numerous people familiar with the White House's anticipated order, the most far-reaching element will be instructing a trio of Cabinet departments to rewrite federal rules for association health plans - a type of insurance in which small businesses of a similar type band together through an association to negotiate health benefits. The order also is expected to expand the availability of short-term insurance policies, which offer limited benefits meant as a bridge for people between jobs or young adults no longer eligible for their parents' health plans. The Obama administration ruled that short-term insurance may not last for more than three months; Trump is planning to extend that to nearly a year. In addition, Trump's action is intended to widen employers' ability to use pretax dollars to help workers pay for any medical expenses, not just for health policies that meet ACA rules - another reversal of Obama policy. The executive order will fulfill a quest by conservative Republicans, especially in the House, who have unsuccessfully sought for more than two decades to expand the availability of association health plans, allowing them to be sold, unregulated, across state lines. As details of what the president is likely to sign spread in Washington in recent days, health policy experts in think tanks, academia and the health-care industry emphasized that the order's final language - and the ensuing fine print from agencies' rules - will determine whether the impact will be as sweeping or quick as Trump has boasted. \"It's going to cover a lot of territory and a lot of people, millions of people,\" the president said two weeks ago. On Tuesday, he added: \"It will be great, great health care for many, many people.\" In an interview Wednesday night with Sean Hannity of Fox News, he again predicted a big impact. \"People say 30 percent, some people say 25 percent and some people say it could be 50 percent,\" Trump told Hannity. \"It's going to cover a large percentage of the people that we're talking about.\" The action will come three weeks before the Nov. 1 start of the fifth open-enrollment season in ACA marketplaces for people who do not have access to affordable health benefits through a job. It is uncertain whether the departments - Health and Human Services, Treasury and Labor - will finalize rules carrying out the order in time for new insurance to be sold for 2018. Even so, with a shortened sign-up period and large cuts in federal funds for advertising and enrollment help already hobbling the marketplaces, \"if there's a lot of hoopla around new options that may be available soon, it could be one more thing that discourages enrollment,\" said Larry Levitt, Kaiser Family Foundation's senior vice president. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) is among the groups that have long opposed any expansion of coverage that bypasses state regulation. In congressional testimony in February, the NAIC said allowing health plans to be sold without requiring either state licenses or federal approval \"would result in less protections for the most vulnerable populations and the collapse of individual markets.\" Under the president's anticipated order, association health plans will be able to avoid many ACA rules, including the law's benefits requirements, limits on consumers' yearly and lifetime costs, and ban on charging more to customers who have been sick. Critics say that young and healthy people who use relatively little insurance would gravitate to those plans because of their lower price tags, while older and sicker customers would be concentrated in ACA marketplaces with spiking rates. \"It would be different pools under different rules,\" said one senior health policy source who spoke on the condition of anonymity since the order is not yet public. Currently, short-term health insurance makes up a tiny fraction of the policies sold, with fewer than 30 companies covering only about 160,000 people nationwide at the end of last year, according to NAIC data. Experts could not point to figures for how many association health plans exist or how many people they insure. Such arrangements have existed for decades, and scandals have on occasion exposed \"multi-employer welfare arrangements\" started by unscrupulous operators who took members' money and either did not have enough reserves to cover hospital bills or absconded with premiums. The National Federation of Independent Business, the small-business lobby, has pressed Congress to allow use of association plans, arguing that they can be less expensive and give workers more insurance choices. This year, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, pushed an amendment to unsuccessful ACA-repeal legislation that would have had a parallel effect, letting any insurer selling at least one policy that met the law's coverage rules also sell skimpier and cheaper plans. Selling health plans from state to state without separate licenses - the idea underlying much of the president's anticipated order - has long been a Republican mantra. It has gained little traction in practice, however.

{"global_context": "Despite immense pressure to act, members of Congress are badly divided and prospects for consequential agreement seem slim. Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut and an author, with Mr. Cornyn, of the more limited background check bill, equated taking up his own legislation without allowing consideration of alternatives to “slamming the door in the face of all these kids who are demanding change.” “I think it is imperative that we rise to the moment,” Mr. Murphy said. Democrats are not yet threatening to block debate on the background measure if Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, decides to bring it to the floor with no chance to add to it. They are leery of taking that step because it would allow Republicans to accuse them of blocking consensus legislation that many of them are co-sponsoring and stifling a debate they say they want. But they also don’t want Republicans to get credit for passing something that Democrats view as too narrow. Instead, they hope to persuade Mr. McConnell to allow votes on multiple proposals, a plan that could throw the Senate into a full-blown showdown over competing gun control measures. While Mr. McConnell has been quiet about his intentions, Mr. Cornyn opened the door to that possibility provided it could get to passage of his bill at a minimum.

Underscoring the difficulties of getting any measure passed, some conservative Republicans, including Senator Mike Lee of Utah, are opposed to that bipartisan bill on the grounds that it could deprive people of the opportunity to challenge their inclusion on a list used to deny them the ability to buy a gun. Mr. McConnell is never one to rush into a fight that divides his own party if he can avoid it. Colleagues say he would prefer to quickly reach a resolution and move on, a prospect that does not appear in the cards so far. Advertisement Continue reading the main story As lawmakers quibbled about how to proceed, some of the multiple proposals promoted by Mr. Trump were falling by the wayside. Republican lawmakers seem uninterested in plans to raise the age to buy all guns to 21. The idea of arming teachers was also getting a cold reception. Among plans circulating that could draw bipartisan support was a measure that would prevent those on federal no-fly lists from buying guns, though that approach has met Republican resistance in the past. Hoping to skirt a divisive debate, Republicans preferred to focus on other remedies, like improving general school safety, while pointing to law enforcement failures surrounding the Parkland shooting. The uncertainty in the Senate was also lifting some of the pressure to act from Republican leaders in the House. “Well, find out what the Senate can do and then we’ll address that,” Speaker Paul D. Ryan said. Democrats remained skeptical that Republicans would be willing to buck the N.R.A., particularly in an election year, but said it would be an imperative for legislative success. “You can’t solve this problem and please the N.R.A.,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. “Our Republican colleagues need to learn that.” Given longstanding political conflict over the issue, many lawmakers in both parties anticipate the push for new laws will likely fall apart as so many others have in the aftermath of mass shootings. If that is the outcome, the determined high school students and their allies who have helped drive the debate to this point seem unlikely to let the issue go. Maybe the difference this time isn’t that Congress will act, but it is that those pushing Congress will not allow lawmakers to so quickly move on after they don’t.

On Tuesday’s “Hugh Hewitt Show,” Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) stated he will offer an amendment this week to the spending bill to end the separation of families at the border by allowing families to be held at the border and giving extra money for family housing units. He also panned the bill proposed by Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) as one that says, “children at the border are literally a get out of jail free card.” Cotton said, “I am working with many senators to get this solution on the spending bill we’re considering this week. The Trump administration’s hands are tied by liberal judges and Democrats, who have ruled over the years that children at the border can’t be detained for more than 20 days. That’s why, when their parents bring them to the border, or just as likely, kidnap them or buy them from human traffickers to pose as parents at the border, the parent is taken into custody, the child can’t be detained for more than 20 days, and is therefore placed with a relative or placed in a kind of foster care. All we need to do, Hugh, is overturn the so-called Flores Settlement, allow families to be held at the border, provide a little bit of extra money to the military and DHS for family housing units while those claims are adjudicated. We’re going to offer an amendment this week on the spending bill. It can be done promptly.” Cotton also criticized the bill proposed by Democrats, saying, “What the Democrats are proposing is their most radical, open borders, lawless proposal yet. Let’s just call a spade a spade, Hugh. 49 Democrats have now supported a bill by Dianne Feinstein that says children at the border are literally a get out of jail free card. If you show up at our border, you have to be released into our country, never to be seen again. They are literally a get out of jail free card, and a get into the US free card. Moreover, Hugh, let’s look at this from another angle. All across America, there are parents who are separated from their children because they have been arrested for a crime, or they’ve been convicted of a crime.

It’s pretty amazing how Trump is trying to manufacture imaginary terrorism threats at the Mexican border, while his followers are creating real terrorism on anyone who disagrees with Trump. Republicans and Trump went absolutely bonkers over Hillary Clinton's use of a private server, though there was never any evidence that information on it was compromised. Now Trump refuses to give up his personal, unsecured iPhones even though our intelligence services are confident that both the Chinese and the Russians are listening to everything he says on them. Every Republican running for reelection voted to overturn the ACA. Now they are saying they want to keep pre-existing conditions. If you voted against the ACA, you are a hypocrite and don't deserve anyone’s vote. The information released by what Trump call “Fake News” always turns out to be true. A journalist is murdered by Saudi agents; Trump praised a GOP House member who assaulted a journalist. A bomb is sent to a media organization; Trump constantly denounces media organizations. How is this “lacking in moral clarity?” The Democrats have been trying their best to crash the stock market and the economy before the November midterms so that they could blame it on Trump. Looks like they have been halfway successful with the stock market. The Democrats have no concern for we retirees that depend upon the stock market for retirement funding. My bets are that the stock market comes roaring back. Democrats are so petty! Early on he told his base to use their second amendment rights if Hillary Clinton was elected. That should have told us all we needed to know about him. Republicans have voted to repeal Obamacare what, fifty times in the past two or three years? They couldn't get the votes to repeal the whole thing, so they started chipping away at it, defunding key provisions, shortening sigh-up periods, and refusing to provide important information to the public. But now that they know the vast majority of Americans like it, they're brazenly trying to claim that they've supported it all along, especially the part about pre-existing conditions. Don't believe it. They are liars, just like their liar-in-chief. If you see me raking instead of mulching, three of my trees have a black spot fungus on the leaves. No a concern (per an expert), but I'm trying to keep it from spreading. Well, that didn't take long. At his latest rally, in Wisconsin, Trump condemned the bombs being sent through the mail but then turned on a dime and blamed his \"Democrat\" critics and the media, who constantly spread lies about him. Trump considers himself the center of the universe, and if there is trouble, it's caused by people being critical of him. Of course his fanatical followers totally agree. Ann Coulter, Rush Limbaugh, James Woods, Michael Flynn Jr and a list of other Trump backers have suggested that the bombs are just a liberal hoax. But if a bomb had been sent to Fox News, Mitch McConnell, Lindsey Graham, Brett Kavanaugh or someone in the Trump family, all hell would have broke loose. Political terrorism has never been an accepted part of our political campaigns. Trump’s “anything-goes to win” can not be tolerated. Will it take a loss of life to make people understand this? So now that the stock market has dropped again, and has now wiped out the gains for the entire year, is Trump still your knight in shining armor? Donald Trump is an absolute disgrace to this country. He is constantly blaming and condemning the democrats, the news media and anyone else he can find to blame for his inability to face the truth. His is dividing this country with hate I have never seen in my 74 years on this earth, while the Republicans do nothing about it. People at his rallies laugh at his disgusting remarks.

{"global_context": "Ralph Northam now reportedly does not believe he appears in a racist photo and has no immediate plans to resign. In a stunning reversal, Gov. Ralph Northam (D-VA) now says he does not believe he appears in a photo which shows two individuals in blackface and KKK uniform and has no immediate plans to resign, according to a Virginia Democrat who spoke to the embattled lawmaker, the Associated Press reports. On Friday evening, Northam acknowledged he was in the photo, yet declined to reveal which attire he wore. The Democrat, who said they were “not authorized” to speak publically on the matter, told the news outlet that Northam is phoning state lawmakers Saturday in an attempt to shore up support that has all but evaporated the prior evening. Northam has faced a torrent of criticism and calls for his resignation after a photo surfaced from decades ago that showed two people in racist costumes: One person is dressed in blackface, and another is wearing a full Ku Klux Klan uniform. The photo appeared in Northam’s 1984 medical school yearbook. However, former political allies say Northam appears to have almost no choice but to resign after losing support from virtually the entire state Democratic party and other key allies, who late Friday urged the governor to leave office because of the racist photo. The Virginia Legislative Black Caucus, the state House Democratic Caucus, and the state Senate Democratic Caucus all called on Northam to resign, along with several key progressive groups that have been some of the governor’s closest political allies. Their calls for Northam to step down came in a wave late Friday after the Democrat had apologized for appearing in a photo in which one person is dressed in blackface and another is wearing a full Ku Klux Klan uniform. The photo appeared in his 1984 medical school yearbook. The yearbook images were first published Friday afternoon by the conservative news outlet Big League Politics. The Virginian-Pilot later obtained a copy from Eastern Virginia Medical School, which Northam attended. The photo shows two people looking at the camera — one in blackface wearing a hat, bow tie and plaid pants; the other in a full Ku Klux Klan robe. In his first apology, issued in a written statement, Northam called the costume he wore “clearly racist and offensive,” but he didn’t say which one he had worn. He later issued a video statement saying he was “deeply sorry” but still committed to serving the “remainder of my term.” “I accept responsibility for my past actions and I am ready to do the hard work of regaining your trust,” Northam said. But Northam appears to have virtually no path forward to remain in office without any institutional support. His departure would mean current Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, a Democrat who is only the second African American to win statewide office in Virginia, would be the next governor. Northam’s term was set to end in 2022. Black lawmakers said they met with Northam Friday evening and said in a statement they appreciate his service. “But given what was revealed today, it is clear that he can no longer effectively serve as governor,” the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus said, “It is time for him to resign, so that Virginia can begin the process of healing.” Several Democrat presidential hopefuls, including Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Kamala Harris (D-CA) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), have called on Northam to jettison his post. “Leaders are called to a higher standard, and the stain of racism should have no place in the halls of government. The Governor of Virginia should step aside so the public can heal and move forward together,” Harris said in a statement. Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner (D-VA) condemned Northam, calling the photo “racist” and “deeply offensive,” — however — the pair stopped short of calling on him to resign. The racist photo of Governor Northam’s 1984 yearbook is horrible. This causes pain in a state and a country where centuries of racism have already left an open wound,” said Kaine. “I hope the Governor–whose career as an Army officer, pediatrician and public official has always manifested a commitment to justice and equality for all–now takes the time to listen to those he has hurt and reflect on how to move forward.” In a separate statement, Warner described the photo as “shocking and deeply offensive,” citing Virginia’s “long and painful history of racism and violence toward African-Americans.” “The Governor must now listen to the people and communities he has hurt, and carefully consider what comes next,” he concluded.

It also highlights trips to Iowa by GOP Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Ben Sasse of Nebraska and a possible return trip to New Hampshire by former presidential candidate and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who has not ruled out another presidential bid. It says “would-be candidates” are cultivating prominent donors and courting prominent conservative interest groups. The report says the “sheer disarray” surrounding Trump’s presidency has prompted Republican officeholders “to take political steps unheard-of so soon into a new administration.” “Mr. Pence is methodically establishing his own identity and bestowing personal touches on people who could pay dividends in the future. He not only spoke in June at one of the most important yearly events for Iowa Republicans, Senator Joni Ernst’s pig roast, but he also held a separate, more intimate gathering for donors afterward,” the story says. Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, said Sunday on ABC’s This Week that Trump “plans on being a two-term president.” She said she has “zero concern” that Pence is setting up a shadow campaign, calling the allegation “complete fiction.” “It is absolutely true that the vice president is getting ready for 2020, for re-election as vice president,” she said.

{"global_context": "American voters don’t always get it right. But they usually do, at least when you look at the big picture, a truism reinforced by the 2018 midterm elections. This was the first big chance for the U.S. electorate to offer its interim verdict on Donald Trump. It was also the first national election since the explosion of the #MeToo movement. In its collective wisdom, American voters managed to validate women while rejecting the most jarring excesses of the anti-Trump “Resistance” — namely the Democrats’ keelhauling of Brett Kavanaugh. In so doing, the voters reinforced the primary principles embedded in English common law, imported to these shores and enshrined in the Constitution. It’s a historical lesson we must continually re-learn. Four centuries before Judge Kavanaugh found himself facing accusations of inappropriate sexual conduct as a teenager, Sir Walter Raleigh stood in the dock. A famed explorer, soldier and courtier, Raleigh was accused of plotting to murder King James I. The formal charge was treason. In his own inquisition before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Kavanaugh was not on trial for his life — as Raleigh was — but the tactics employed against him would have felt familiar to the Englishman. Both men faced juries convinced of their guilt before the trial began. In both cases, their juries treated mere accusations as proof of guilt. Both were buffeted by hearsay testimony. The evidence against Raleigh consisted of coerced testimony from a man who claimed to be a co-conspirator. But the prosecutor didn’t produce him. Raleigh, handling his own defense, asserted a right to face his accuser. The law requiring that was changed, he was told. It’s a principle embedded in English common law, he replied. Not so, claimed the magistrates hearing his case, and irrelevant — we have an affidavit. Raleigh’s judges were wrong. The right to face your accuser was rooted in common law, and had been for a thousand years. It was brought to the British Isles by the Romans. It’s a principle spelled out in the Bible — and more than once cited by the United States Supreme Court. Nonetheless, Kavanaugh’s initial accuser first wanted to level allegations without her name being used. When it was leaked, she wanted to avoid testifying in public. Her attorney insisted that the man she was accusing not be present in the room. The Judiciary Committee, 415 years after Walter Raleigh’s trial, acceded to this demand. And so, the Judiciary Committee Democrats rendered their pre-ordained verdict: guilty. One of them, Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, declared publicly that he believed Christine Blasey Ford before she testified. Another, Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, claimed that Ford “needs to be believed,” and that men need to “just shut up.” Ford may have had a psychological need to be believed, but the longer she talked about how a 17-year-old Brett Kavanaugh tried to force himself on her, the less credible she sounded. She claimed to remember dramatic details, but, conveniently could recall no facts that could be independently verified. When she did provide “corroborating” evidence, it undermined her story. The woman who she said introduced her to Kavanaugh all those years ago said she never met him. Other stuff didn’t add up either. Although she was hesitant to come to Washington, D.C., from her California home because of a fear of flying, it turns out that she flies all over the world to go surfing — and had flown to the East Coast on vacation even while sparring with the Judiciary Committee. Her odd story about how her near-rape experience produced an anxiety leading to a desire for “two front doors” in her house unraveled, too. The second door allowed her to rent part of her house to a psychologist who specializes in — wait for it — recovering memories through hypnotism. She also was coy about releasing her therapist’s notes, the polygraph test she took, about how she found the liberal activist lawyer who represented her. In the end, the #MeToo-generation liberals decided that the moral of the story was the U.S. Senate needs more Democrats, preferably women. Look at the Republicans on the committee, they said. Lacking a single female, they had to hire an outside prosecutor just to get a woman up there asking questions. Republicans and many independents had the opposite reaction: They concluded that Democrats are perfectly willing to smear men to prevent a judicial appointment they oppose. They no longer care about the rule of law or due process — foundational rights of all Americans. This is where Walter Raleigh reenters our story. His prosecutor, and the judges, found him guilty. It was a pre-ordained verdict, just like that of the Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats. But his trial was open to the public, as were Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings, and Raleigh’s trial altered people’s minds. He was adjudged in the court of public opinion to have been railroaded. Sometimes that’s the best place to stand trial. In Kavanaugh’s case, Americans are too divided along partisan lines to reach a consensus like that. But five Democratic senators from solidly Republican states stood for re-election this year. Four of them, Joe Donnelly, Claire McCaskill, Heidi Heitkamp and Jon Tester, voted against Kavanaugh — and three lost decisively. The fifth, Joe Manchin, voted to confirm Kavanaugh and he won. These election returns were a welcome development for democracy. There were other signs, too, including ticket-splitters in Vermont who gave Democratic socialist Bernie Sanders two-thirds of the vote while giving Vermont’s Republican governor 55 percent. The most hopeful sign was the success of an array of female candidates. If red state conservatives and swing voters were reminding the national parties that character assassination is a bad thing, suburban women across the country were serving notice that the old ways of doing business are gone forever. Sexual assault and sexual harassment aren’t figments of the feminist imagination. Bill Cosby raped women for decades. Harvey Weinstein, the overwhelming evidence indicates, was a sexual predator almost as long. From the day women entered the workforce, men like Bill O’Reilly and Les Moonves made sexual harassment a landmine in the American workplace. Millions of women had personal experience with it, traumatic experiences they began sharing. This was a crisis of culture long in the making — and the 2018 accounting was long overdue. As the votes were tabulated Tuesday, it was clear that one aspect of this reckoning was taking place in elective office. President Trump may have thought that losing 30 House seats was a victory, but for the suburban voters who backed those Democrats it was a rebuke — of Trumpism and powerful men who exploit women sexually. Record numbers of women sought elective office in 2018, and record numbers won. All kinds of women.

The first two Native American women were elected to Congress, along with the first two Muslim women. Massachusetts and Connecticut also sent African-American women to Washington, the first time those states have done so. A female military pilot (two if Martha McSally prevails) and other veterans won office. Let’s lift a glass to these women. And toast the concept of due process for all Americans.

Buoyed by a summary of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation that found \"no collusion\" with Russia, Trump is certain to highlight those findings at a time when he is also reasserting his agenda on health care, trade and other issues. The political symbolism of Michigan is hard to miss: A triumphant president, free from a cloud that hung over the White House for months, will return to Grand Rapids, the site of the final rally of his 2016 campaign that some analysts believe pushed him over the edge to victory in the Wolverine State. But Trump will find a more complicated landscape when he arrives in the state he won by less than one percentage point in 2016. Democrats won all four statewide races in Michigan in last year's midterm and polls show Trump's approval there is below the national average. The Thursday night rally will be Trump's first in the Rust Belt since last year's midterm election. \"This is his entry back into the Midwest,\" said Steve Mitchell a pollster and Republican strategist based in East Lansing. \"But I believe Michigan is going to be very difficult for him to take in 2020 unless there's a viable third-party candidate.\" President Donald Trump speaks in Grand Rapids, Michigan, during the early morning hours of Election Day, Nov. 8, 2016. (Photo: Paul Sancya, AP) Trump, post Mueller Trump has been taking a victory lap in Washington since Attorney General William Barr's summary of Mueller's report found his campaign did not conspire with Russia in the 2016 election. Now he's taking that celebratory circuit on the road. Mueller made no determination about whether Trump sought to obstruct justice, but the president's supporters have dismissed that equivocation, focusing instead on Barr's determination that the evidence Mueller collected did not, in his view, constitute a crime. The president railed against the investigations – some of which are ongoing – throughout the midterm campaign. While it's likely he'll do so again in Michigan, analysts said the probes will probably not drive a lot of votes. \"The Mueller report doesn't change anybody's mind on anything,\" said Lansing-based pollster Richard Czuba. \"It's all baked in.\" Since the release of Barr's four-page summary, the White House has embraced a two-pronged approach: criticizing Democrats who questioned Trump while stepping up a focus on policy. The Trump administration surprised observers Monday when it asked a court to toss out the Affordable Care Act in a lawsuit filed by Republican-led states. Trump has also increased his outreach to lawmakers on trade this week, meeting with Republican lawmakers on a pending trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. But at least some of those policies have made for tricky politics in Michigan. Farmers in the state have been hit by lower prices, in part because of trade tensions with China that Trump has initiated. Auto executives, including GM CEO Mary Barra, have pointed to Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs to explain recent plant closures. Michigan's unemployment rate stood at 4 percent in February, slightly above the national rate of 3.8 percent but still well below its position two years ago. Return to Michigan Grand Rapids was the site of Trump's last campaign stop in the 2016 campaign, a raucous affair that didn't end until the early hours of Election Day itself. Given the close margin in a state that was originally touted by Democrats as part of Clinton's infamous \"blue wall,\" some analysts said Trump's rally may have put him over the top. \"President Trump expanded the map, winning states that Republicans had not won in decades,\" Trump campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement. \"Among these states was Michigan, a state that no Republican nominee had won since 1988.\" That candidate was President George H.W. Bush. Four years later, Michigan voted for Democrat Bill Clinton instead. But Trump's favorability rating dropped to 40 percent in a recent EPIC-MRA poll, down from 43 percent favorable when the same pollster questioned voters in October. That same poll found more than half of those surveyed either plan to vote for someone else or are considering doing so next year. The rally will be Trump's 18th in Michigan since he announced his candidacy in 2015, according to the campaign – his sixth in Grand Rapids. Kent County, which surrounds the city, is considered a traditional GOP stronghold, though it has become more competitive recently. \"That's why he's going back there,\" Mitchell said. \"If you don't have Kent County, it's very difficult to win the state.\" Read or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/03/28/donald-trump-michigan-rally-first-since-robert-mueller-report-summary/3288404002/.

{"global_context": "Brenda Wineapple’s “The Impeachers” is a revealing history of the trial of Andrew Johnson in 1868. The reign of racist terror hardly troubled Johnson, for he was to his very bones a vicious racist. “This is a country for white men,” Johnson had been heard to say, “and by God, as long as I am president it shall be a government for white men.” He scoffed at the accounts of violence as Radical propaganda, the lurid fabrications of abolitionist fanatics. He hated the Freedmen’s Bureau and the radicals who supported it, even comparing it to slavery itself, and he loathed the idea of black suffrage. “Negroes have shown less capacity for government than any other race of people,” he proclaimed, and warned against efforts to “Africanize the half of our country.” Image Credit Such views were not uncommon, of course, and in fact at the beginning of Johnson’s tenure, Northern white elites, not to mention the masses, had little or no enthusiasm for actual racial equality. But as the atrocities in the South got worse and the defeated traitors appeared to be snatching an improbable victory from the ashes of defeat, Northern politicians radicalized, and increasingly saw Johnson’s administration as a dangerous failure, his invective toward Congress and his constant vetoes of even modest legislation intolerable. After a supremely ill-fated midterm campaign in 1866, in which Johnson brayed before crowds like a self-pitying martyr, Republicans won landslide victories. Their overwhelming majorities empowered the so-called Radicals, men like Thaddeus Stevens, Charles Sumner and Wendell Phillips, who were not only abolitionists, but believed, in Phillips’s words, in “impartial justice to all races and people.” Johnson was determined to make sure that never happened, and when Congress convened in 1867, impeachment became a possible course of action. But there were several hard questions. The problems with Johnson were obvious: He was a racist demagogue unfit for the office he held. But was that an impeachable offense? Had he committed a high crime or misdemeanor? Contemporaries wrestled with the question of whether a clear-cut legal infraction was necessary, and the most aggressive members of Congress (and some of the most self-serving) started several investigations to find some kind of smoking gun. They pursued unfounded rumors that he had invited prostitutes into the White House, and was even implicated in the assassination of Lincoln. When those expeditions came to nothing, the House Judiciary Committee originally voted in 1867 against impeaching the president. But as Johnson vetoed bill after bill designed to protect black Southerners and white loyalists and strip former Confederates of power, tensions between Congress and the president mounted. Congressional Republicans, with huge majorities borne of the fact that the Southern states had still not been readmitted, took matters into their own hands. Using their veto-proof majorities, they began to institute their own vision of Reconstruction, partnering with two heroes of the war who still held positions in the executive branch, Gen. Ulysses S. Grant and Secretary of War Edwin Stanton. Under congressional Reconstruction, the Southern states were divided into military zones to be occupied and administered by the armed forces while they rewrote their constitutions and rebuilt new biracial governments for all their citizens. Ratification of the 14th Amendment was made a condition of their readmittance to the Union. This made for some odd bedfellows. Even though the Department of War was constitutionally under the president, it operated as a kind of quasi-independent entity to administer Reconstruction against the wishes of the commander in chief. “It was Johnson who was defying the laws of Congress and, in turn, the Army was defying him,” says Wineapple, the author of several books on American history and American culture. “The situation was approaching mutiny on one side,” one of Grant’s aides wrote, “or else treason on the other.” In order to safeguard this arrangement against an increasingly vindictive and erratic president, Congress used its veto-override to pass the constitutionally dubious Tenure in Office Act. It required the president to get Senate approval to remove his own cabinet officials. On Feb. 21, 1868, Johnson triggered the impeachment tripwire when he defied Congress and sacked Stanton. The House promptly impeached him on 11 articles, the bulk of which dealt with Stanton’s removal. Though much anticipated, the actual trial of Johnson ended up being more than a bit anticlimactic. In Wineapple’s telling, it quickly descended into near-constant disputes over process and authority: Who gets to rule what will and won’t be admissible? What witnesses can be called? Did Johnson intend to violate the law or merely challenge its constitutionality? The question of conviction would turn largely on the president’s intent, and this proved a difficult thing to divine.

After 15 years in politics, Rahul Gandhi is beginning to articulate a vision for India that some observers say is making him a more credible leader. But it's unclear whether Gandhi, who is president of the opposition Congress party, has rallied enough support in time to defeat Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Gandhi, 48, has often been the object of derision from political rivals, who accuse him, despite his pedigree, of being a lightweight. In contrast to Modi, a tea seller's son who went on to become India's leader, Gandhi inherited his power, making him an easy target of charges of nepotism and dynasty politics. For years, Modi and other leaders of his Bharatiya Janata Party have referred to Gandhi as the \"shehzada,\" or prince. Critics accuse him of being aloof, a cosmopolitan elite detached from the harsh realities of India's legions of rural poor. After Congress' hold in Parliament collapsed from 206 of 543 seats to a mere 44 seats in 2014 elections, Gandhi's political obituary was all but written. But with small businesses and farmers hurt by some of Modi's signature policies, and mob attacks on Muslims on the rise, Gandhi and the inclusive, secular politics the Congress party has long represented are starting to resonate. Gandhi is seeking re-election for a fourth consecutive time in the Uttar Pradesh town of Amethi. The general election, which is being held in seven phases, ends May 19, and vote counting begins on May 23. \"In finding his feet in politics, Gandhi has become a perfect foil for Modi,\" said political commentator Seema Mustafa. \"He comes through as humble, democratic and responsive, and plays on love, peace and humanity as against hate and aggression. The smile against the wagging finger, the embrace against the threat — it is all now part of a persona, natural and yet crafted.\" If Gandhi came across as a reluctant politician, the reasons are not hard to find. His family, starting with his great-grandfather, Jawahalal Nehru, has produced three prime ministers. Two of them, his grandmother Indira Gandhi and father, Rajiv Gandhi, were assassinated in office. \"In my life, I have seen my grandmother die, I have seen my father die, I have seen my grandmother go to jail, and I have actually been through a tremendous amount of a pain as a child,\" Gandhi said in a 2014 interview with an Indian TV channel. Even after becoming a lawmaker, he distanced himself from political life, refusing to even call himself a candidate for prime minister. In 2014, he was re-elected in Amethi, considered a Gandhi bastion, by only a thin margin. Yet, under relentless public scrutiny, Gandhi has honed his public speaking and leadership skills. He now comes across as more confident, forceful and credible, according to political analysts. And he is also starting to come across as a vigorous and even pugnacious campaigner. In Parliament, where he's represented Amethi since 2004, he had been a backbencher, leaving the party reins largely to his mother, Sonia Gandhi. But he's started to hit back. One recent barb in particular struck home — he taunted Modi for wearing a monogrammed suit worth $14,400, saying that Modi's \"suit-boot\" government was only for the rich. Perhaps most important, Gandhi has shown he has the stomach for a fight, even challenging Modi, a much more experienced politician, to a public debate. Modi has ignored the challenge. Gandhi's biggest political triumph in 15 years was easily Congress' win in assembly elections in December, wrangling power away from Modi's BJP in the states of Rajasthan, Madya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Suddenly, the BJPs' preferred Gandhi jibe — \"pappu,\" Hindi for greenhorn — began to fall flat. Suhsmita Dave, head of the Congress party's women's wing, said she has known Gandhi well for a decade and he's basically the same man. The only difference, she said, is that earlier, he held back out of respect for protocol, letting his mother run the party and Manmohan Singh lead the Congress-controlled government. \"He let them get on with their jobs. This gave the BJP a chance to paint him as a reluctant politician,\" Dave said. \"But the truth is that he was never a leader in a hurry. He waited his turn. When it came, he took the bull by the horns and has been vocal and aggressive. There is no point firing your gun until the time is right.\" Still, critics say there's a long way to go. Gandhi brought his sister, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, into the party, appointing her to oversee a post in the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh that includes Varanasi, the Hindu holy city where Modi is up for re-election as a member of Parliament. Her popularity has drawn huge crowds to campaign events, but it may not be enough to counter her brother's perceived sluggishness. Gandhi has been criticized for his low attendance in the last Parliament, showing up just over half the time; for being abroad at critical moments; for describing power as \"poison\"; for not cultivating a younger generation of Congress leaders; and for failing to fulfill a promise to overhaul his party's hierarchy. He also was unable to forge an alliance with two important opposition parties in vote-rich Uttar Pradesh to wrest power away from the BJP in the current election. In New Delhi, too, he was unable to tie up with the ruling party to combat the BJP. Whatever the result of the election, Gandhi is now seen as a feisty opponent, most recently in an interview with the daily Indian Express newspaper. \"That destruction of the idea of an invincible Mr. Modi, that destruction of the lie of Mr. Modi, is primarily the work of the Congress party,\" he said.

{"global_context": "Republicans have accused Peter Strzok, who previously worked on special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, of being anti-Trump. WASHINGTON ― FBI agent Peter Strzok helped draft a letter that, in the final days of the 2016 presidential campaign, signaled the re-opening of a probe into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s emails, CNN reported Wednesday. Strzok is one of the FBI agents whom some Republicans have accused of scheming to undermine President Donald Trump ahead of the 2016 election. He worked on both the Clinton probe as well as the Russia probe when it was in its early stages, and later joined special counsel Robert Mueller’s team. The letter Strzok helped draft, sent to Congress by then-FBI Director James Comey on Oct. 28 ― days ahead of the 2016 election ― dealt a blow to Clinton, whom Trump repeatedly attacked for using a personal email while serving as secretary of state. Comey penned another letter just before the election saying no new relevant information was found, and stood by the FBI’s prior decision not to recommend charges The FBI’s actions ahead of the 2016 campaign hurt Clinton, while the bureau stayed quiet about its ongoing probe into ties between Trump associates and Russia. Nevertheless, many Republicans have been working off of the idea that the FBI’s actions somehow hurt Trump’s election, and say the FBI continued to work behind the scenes to undermine his presidency. Republicans have seized upon text messages between Strzok and an FBI attorney with whom he had a relationship, Lisa Page. Neither were fans of Trump, but they also exchanged texts venting about Democratic politicians and figures as well. One particular text ― a joke about a “secret society” sent hours after Trump’s election ― drew lots of attention from Republicans, who painted it as evidence of a vast conspiracy within the bureau. As it turned out, the joke was made in connection with gag gift calendars Strzok had bought for the team working on the Russia probe that featured “beefcake” photos of Russian President Vladimir Putin. CNN reported that Strzok did have reservations about Comey making the announcement public, and text messages showed they were troubled by the fallout from the letter. “Christ. It’s there led on freaking MARKETPLACE,” Page texted, an apparent reference to the NPR show. “Our statement affected the stock market. 😡” FBI texts Republican theories about the actions of the two FBI employees haven’t really panned out, as HuffPost has reported. Republicans suggested that they were leaking anti-Trump information to the media, when in reality, Page cooperated with a story in which she defended the bureau’s handling of the Clinton probe. Another set of texts indicated they rejected an outsider’s suggestion that the FBI should have gone after agents leaking information about the Clinton investigation by monitoring an ex-FBI official’s phone.

WASHINGTON ― Lawmakers in the House issued more than $100,000 in taxpayer-funded settlements to address sexual harassment claims from 2008 to 2012, according to new data released Tuesday. The Office of Compliance, where lawmakers and staffers file such claims, provided the numbers to the Committee on House Administration, which deals with the chamber’s rules and regulations, amid a recent cascade of sexual misconduct allegations against lawmakers that has forced congressional leaders to re-examine procedures for dealing with such incidents. According to the data, there were at least three settlements related to sexual harassment claims involving unnamed House members’ offices from 2008 to 2012, totaling $115,000. That was part of a total of more than $340,000 in settlements involving House offices, which also included various cases of discrimination. The settlements, which are not named, came from a little-known Treasury Department fund that is used to settle workplace claims involving Capitol Hill lawmakers. Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call via Getty Images Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas) announced he will not seek re-election amid sexual harassment allegations. In 2014, Farenthold reportedly used the taxpayer fund to pay $84,000 to settle a sexual harassment claim from his former communications director, Lauren Greene. According to the Office of Compliance, that settlement was the only House payment from the fund over the last five years that involved sexual harassment. Farenthold would not confirm or deny that the payment involved his office, saying in a statement that “the Congressional Accountability Act prohibits me from answering that question.” Some lawmakers have now called for more transparency involving settlements. Earlier this month, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) called for the release of similar data involving Senate offices. But on Monday, the Office of Compliance denied his request, saying that it “does not possess reliable information.” Legislators in both the House and the Senate have introduced proposals to restrict the use of taxpayer-funded settlements.

{"global_context": "Four candidates running for Chicago mayor visited the Tribune Editorial Board on Thursday, the final round of interviews in the newspaper’s endorsement process. The name Laquan McDonald was mentioned once, maybe twice. But it didn’t need to be repeated. His life and the circumstances surrounding his October 2014 death at the hands of a now-convicted Chicago police officer are embedded in policy discussions unfolding in the race for mayor. In some ways, Laquan is still here. From city violence to police accountability to neighborhood investment and mental health services, the death of Laquan is yielding a federal consent decree that likely will overhaul how the Chicago Police Department performs its mission. The next mayor will be responsible for overseeing the consent decree’s execution and, hopefully, translating a tangle of government bureaucracy into actual results: safer streets, fewer victims of crime, trusting relationships with police. That’s the goal. Few candidates know that subject matter better than former federal prosecutor Lori Lightfoot, who oversaw the Chicago Police Board. The board was responsible for disciplining police officers accused of misconduct. She also led a task force that recommended sweeping changes to the Police Department in 2016 following Laquan’s death. Public safety and police reform are among her key priorities. She said that if elected, she would immediately focus on staunching the flow of illegal guns into the city by proactively meeting with officials in surrounding states and crumbling the silos of local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. Another expert on public safety: former police superintendent and now mayoral candidate Garry McCarthy, who has made crime reduction the cornerstone of his campaign. “Nothing is going to change in this city until we make it safe,” he said. Smarter incarceration — keeping violent offenders behind bars, pushing for tougher sentencing laws for illegal possession of a firearm and easing up on incarceration rates for nonviolent criminals — are among his prescriptions for safer streets. He also was known for using data-driven strategies to target crime hot spots, and holding district commanders accountable, until Mayor Rahm Emanuel made him a fall guy and fired him after the Laquan case exploded. Two other candidates, policy consultant Amara Enyia and Southwest Side attorney Jerry Joyce, also offered ideas they said could be implemented swiftly to begin quelling Chicago violence. They both support fortifying neighborhoods and schools as fundamental to tackling crime. But if elected, in the shorter term, Enyia would expand mental health services and send resources to service providers in low-income communities. Joyce would beef up the Police Department to relieve the overworked detectives who now struggle to close cases. WATCH: Stream the final of three mayoral endorsement sessions. » Each candidate offered sensible ideas for a city facing a chronic, multifaceted crime problem and a voting population that in many communities is fearful, frustrated and often victimized. Yes, end-of-year charts showed improvement in Chicago’s homicide numbers. But the drag on the city is far more complicated than a bar graph. Candidates running for mayor are right, of course, to connect Chicago’s violence to its other ills. You don’t get positive outcomes on economic development or education or job creation until you get safer streets. Instead, what you get is exodus.

ZANU-PF accuses Grace Mugabe of \"preaching hate, divisiveness and assuming roles and powers not delegated to the office.\" On Saturday, huge crowds took the streets of Zimbabwe's capital Harare to demonstrate against the Mugabes, who for years have smothered political dissent in the country and brought one what was once one of Africa's wealthiest nations to economic disaster. Mugabe came to power in 1980 after fighting in a war of independence from Britain. “If Mugabe is not gone by Tuesday, then as sure as the sun rises from the east, the impeachment process will kick in,\" said Innocent Gonese of the rival MDC-T party. ZANU-PF's Central Committee expelled several other high-level politicians close to Grace Mugabe on Sunday, including minister of higher education Jonathan Moyo and finance minister Ignatious Chombo. About 200 delegates clapped and cheered the dismissals and also chanted of the president: \"He must go!\" Contributing: Associated Press Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2iu2DKy.

{"global_context": "Could a 40 year old row over shipbuilding legislation involving the then Speaker George Thomas point to a way out of the government's Commons Brexit dilemma?. A Labour government circumvented Speaker George Thomas's controversial ruling in 1976 - could it happen again? A hung Parliament, a Speaker in the firing line, controversial rulings leading to accusations that the chair is biased. Not 2019, but 1976. Not John Bercow, but George Thomas. Not Brexit, but the nationalisation of shipbuilding. This was the issue that provoked the famous incident where Michael Heseltine seized the Mace, the symbol of the Commons' authority and waved it at Labour MPs. The background was that Speaker Thomas, a Labour veteran and former secretary of state for Wales, had ruled that the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill, a nationalisation measure extremely important to the then Labour government, was a hybrid bill (that is a bill that affects different shipyards in different ways), and therefore its consideration could not continue. This ruling may have sounded very technical, but essentially it knocked out a key piece of government legislation, and marked a considerable victory for the Conservative opposition. The ruling was also seen as a betrayal of the Labour tribe in which the Speaker had been raised - tellingly, Neil Kinnock, then a fiery left-wing backbencher shouted out \"Vote Labour, George\" just before he delivered it. \"I am sure that Jim Callaghan and the rest of the Labour leadership never really forgave me…\" he wrote in his memoirs. Bluntly, many Labour ministers thought he became a government stooge. There were no similar scenes when John Bercow this week ruled that the prime minister's Brexit deal could not be brought back for a third \"meaningful vote\" without substantial changes - but it was a moment of huge parliamentary significance, because it stopped the government making repeated attempts to pass the deal, a tactic viewed by some MPs as unduly coercive. But what the ruling does not do is make it impossible for the government to bring the same deal back. Image copyright PA John Bercow has set a test for the government to pass if it wants to hold another vote on its deal The sequel to the events of 1976 could provide a precedent for this year's controversy; the then Clerk of the Commons, Sir Richard Barlas, advised the government that they could push through a motion saying that, notwithstanding the Speaker's ruling, they could go on with their bill - and, woundingly for Speaker Thomas, they did. The lesson for today is that if there is a majority for something in the House of Commons, the House can get its way. MPs can, and frequently do, bend or discard inconvenient rules. They regularly drop the rules about the timing of different stages of legislation to rush bills through. And if there was a majority for some revamped version of the prime minister's Brexit deal, then it could be put to the House if MPs passed a \"paving motion\" setting aside Mr Bercow's ruling. All of which makes the spate of front pages denouncing the Speaker look a little overblown. His ruling may be inconvenient for the PM, but all she needs to get round it is, er, a majority. There is another point to be made; the Brexit crisis has highlighted details of the way the Commons is run which are normally the preserve of parliamentary studies scholars - and in particular the vital importance of the government's control of the Commons agenda. Overwhelmingly, ministers decide what gets debated on and how complicated report stage votes are structured, and these can be critical. (To be sure, there are backbench debates, but there are careful limitations around what can be debated - backbench time cannot be used for legislation, for example.) What Speaker Bercow has done on a couple of occasions is to give a potential Commons majority opportunity to manifest itself, as when he controversially allowed an amendment by Dominic Grieve to a government business of the House motion. Essentially he is not allowing the current government to behave as if it enjoyed a Tony Blair-style majority, when it has no majority at all. Ministers can hardly be expected to enjoy this - they certainly believe he has leaned too far towards Labour - and the result has been some splendidly vitriolic exchanges with Commons leader Andrea Leadsom. But the ultimate lesson is that in a hung Parliament the chair has considerable power, and using that power is certain to make them unpopular with someone.

{"global_context": "The mainstream media is admitting President Trump's economic nationalist victory in taking over the conservative movement and thus, the Republican Party. As the 2018 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) winds down, the mainstream media is admitting President Trump’s economic nationalist victory in taking over the conservative movement and thus, the Republican Party. In POLITICO Magazine, Tim Alberta notes how CPAC attendees booing down of ‘Never Trump’ National Review columnist Mona Charen after she criticized Trump and French economic nationalist Marion Le Pen embodied the shift in which the movement has made away from open borders, free trade, and foreign interventionism. Alberta writes: Charen’s outpouring of dissent accentuated how quickly and completely CPAC has become a pro-Trump gathering, just two years removed from him skipping the event because of a planned walk-out among conservatives who opposed his candidacy. Late Friday morning, with a standing-room-only ballroom full of conservative activists thundering down applause, Trump told of the “horrendous” immigrants taking advantage of our visa lottery system. He warned of dangerous and unproductive people arriving via “chain migration.” And then, underscoring these threats, the president dusted off “The Snake,” a ballad he often recited on the campaign trail, which likens immigrants welcomed by America to a venomous serpent that bites and kills the woman who took it in. It seemed to set a tone. Gaffney, invited back to CPAC after being banished from the event for years, warned that most of the Chinese nationals in the United States are here to spy on Americans. A short while later, Rick Ungar, a left-wing radio host whom Schlapp invited for a panel discussion, was booed when he described a naturalization ceremony—and again when he said that Mexican immigrants have “more in common” with conservatives than liberals. That night, Schlapp’s communications director, Ian Walters, stunned attendees of the event’s trademark Ronald Reagan Dinner by saying the Republican National Committee elected Michael Steele as chairman in 2009 “because he’s a black guy.” All of this in one day—and less than 24 hours after the Trump administration changed the mission statement of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services agency to remove the phrase, “a nation of immigrants.” The Washington Post‘s David Weigel also mentioned the economic nationalist shift at CPAC because of Trump and his popular “America First” agenda. With youth, specifically, the issue of reducing immigration to the U.S. to raise the wages and quality of life of Americans was particularly popular. Weigel writes: In interviews around the conference, CPAC attendees frequently agreed that immigration to the United States should be limited. Angie Ross, a sophomore at St. Mary’s College of Maryland, said immigration policy should reflect that America is “not a charity” but a sovereign country. “I’m a second-generation American, and my family came here based on merit,” said Ross, as she waited in a throng of people trying to meet Nigel Farage. “We’ve had family members who were sent back—they came to Ellis Island, and they didn’t qualify to be here. That’s how it goes. I think we should hold up on immigration for now, because there are so many Americans in poverty.” … Mike Cernovich, a pro-Trump media figure who has argued that Trump “rejected the concept of white guilt” on his way to victory, also made the rounds at CPAC, in advance of a party he had organized for Saturday night. “White guilt won’t win any votes,” said Cernovich. “Guilt is a defensive emotion, based around a need to apologize. Once you start apologizing for something, people will dig up 100 more issues for you to apologize for. Then you’ll never move forward in life.” Trump’s shifting of the conservative movement and Republican Party in a populist, economic nationalist direction is vastly supported by the party’s base of supporters. For example, on immigration, a Harvard-Harris poll last week revealed that GOP voters now say reducing overall immigration to the United States should be the second-greatest priority for Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress. Additionally, nearly half of black Americans say they want to see legal immigration levels greatly reduced, the most supportive demographic group of cutting legal immigration down to between one and 250,000 legal immigrants a year. Likewise, nearly 80 percent of Americans said they supported Trump’s plan to change the country’s immigration system to one based on merit, skills, and English proficiency, rather than the current system where foreign nationals with family members living in the U.S. are given priority. Trump’s efforts to ramp up interior immigration enforcement—where in Fiscal Year 2017 deportations of illegal aliens living throughout the U.S. increased by nearly 40 percent—have been beneficial to America’s working and middle class. For example, the strict immigration enforcement thus far has led to historic wage increases for American workers in the construction industry, the garment industry, for workers employed at small businesses, and black Americans. Opponents of reducing immigration levels include the establishment media, the billionaire GOP mega-donors the Koch brothers, the Democratic Party, the Republican establishment, the Bush dynasty, corporate interests, and the open borders lobby.

{"global_context": "A new report found that, among other issues, physicians weren't properly trained to certify deaths in disasters. The governor of Puerto Rico on Tuesday raised the government’s official death toll for Hurricane Maria from 64 to 2,975 people following the release of a new report. The announcement comes just weeks after officials in Puerto Rico conceded that the hurricane killed more than 1,400 people on the island last year ― over 20 times the official death toll. An independent analysis commissioned by Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Roselló and published Tuesday by researchers at George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health estimated the hurricane killed 2,975 people. That would make it the deadliest U.S. natural disaster in over 100 years. The new analysis offered a more modest estimate than a Harvard study published in May, which reported roughly 4,645 people died in the aftermath of Maria. But both studies confirm what many experts have suspected ― that the hurricane’s death toll was likely in the thousands, far greater than the 64 deaths initially acknowledged by the government. The study analyzed hurricane-caused deaths from September 2017 through the end of February 2018. Researchers identified several factors that may have caused confusion about the death toll, including a lack of communication, guidelines and training for physicians to certify deaths resulting from disasters. That led to an undercounting of deaths, the researchers suggested. “The official government estimate of 64 deaths from the hurricane is low primarily because the conventions used for causal attribution only allowed for classification of deaths attributable directly to the storm, e.g., those caused by structural collapse, flying debris, floods and drownings,” the report stated. “During our broader study, we found that many physicians were not oriented in the appropriate certification protocol. This translated into an inadequate indicator for monitoring mortality in the hurricane’s aftermath.” Researchers also looked at which communities were hardest-hit by the hurricane, which could inform how the island prepares for future disasters. The study found the risk of death was 45 percent higher for populations living in poorer municipalities. “The results of our epidemiological study suggest that, tragically, Hurricane Maria led to a large number of excess deaths throughout the island. Certain groups ― those in lower income areas and the elderly ― faced the highest risk,” said Carlos Santos-Burgoa, the study’s principal investigator, in a statement. He added: “We hope this report and its recommendations will help build the island’s resilience and pave the way toward a plan that will protect all sectors of society in times of natural disasters.” In an interview in Spanish with El Nuevo Día responding to the report, Roselló acknowledged his government’s failings in establishing an effective protocol for measuring the death toll.

Mr Marshall will get back the £46,000 deducted from his farm subsidy as penalty. This was the second judicial review taken against the department and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA) on the issue. Mr Marshall challenged the department in the High Court. The first was after the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) ruled Mr Marshall had deliberately polluted the Mowhan River, close to his farm in County Armagh. 'Accidental pollution' The Department said that 500m of the river had been affected by silage effluent in December 2011. Mr Marshall accepted that the pollution had come from his farm, but said that it was not intentional. Deliberate pollution carries a significantly higher fine than accidental incidents. A stretch of the Mowhan River was affected, officials said The higher fine was applied in Mr Marshall's case and £55,000 of his subsidy payments were withheld. He appealed the fine to an independent panel, who found the polluting incident to have been negligent rather than deliberate. However, a senior DAERA official enforced the original fine.

{"global_context": "Michael Cohen told Congress a lot— and much of it wasn’t good for Donald Trump. Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump’s former lawyer, testifies before the House Oversight and Reform Committee, on Capitol Hill, Wednesday, Feb. 27, 2019, in Washington. (Alex Brandon/Associated Press) WASHINGTON — Michael Cohen told Congress a lot— and much of it wasn’t good for Donald Trump. In matter-of-fact testimony, the former Trump lawyer drew a troubling picture of his former boss, implicating the president in lies big and small to the American public. But Cohen stopped short of saying he had direct evidence that Trump or his campaign conspired with the Kremlin to sway the 2016 election. Here are a few key takeaways. TRUMP SPOKE IN CODE At least when it came to covering up a business deal in Russia. Cohen testified that Trump “in his way” communicated that he wanted his former lawyer to lie to Congress about a Trump Tower Moscow deal he was negotiating during the 2016 presidential campaign. But Cohen said the president was careful not to directly tell him to do so. Even though Trump knew he was negotiating the Russian business deal during the campaign, Cohen said the then-Republican candidate would look him in the eye and tell him “there’s no business in Russia.” Later, Cohen said he lied to be consistent with Trump’s public story. “He doesn’t give you questions, he doesn’t give you orders,” Cohen said. “He speaks in a code, and I understand the code because I’ve been around him for a decade.” Still, Cohen said Trump was more explicit when it came to concealing hush money payments to a porn actress. He said Trump called him in February 2018 and asked him to lie about the payments. Cohen also said Trump had him lie to first lady Melania Trump about them. NO ‘DIRECT’ EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION Cohen says he isn’t aware of direct evidence of coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election. But he does have “suspicions” about it. Cohen testified that Trump was told in advance that WikiLeaks planned to release emails damaging to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 White House campaign. Cohen recounted a phone call in Trump’s office days before the Democratic National Convention when Trump adviser Roger Stone told Trump that WikiLeaks would be releasing a “massive dump” of emails harmful to the Clinton campaign in the coming days. Cohen’s allegation would contradict the president’s assertions that he was in the dark on this issue. It’s not immediately clear what evidence Cohen has to support the allegation or how legally problematic this claim might be for Trump. Stone, even though he is under a gag order, texted reporters Wednesday: “Mr. Cohen’s statement is not true.” THERE’S MORE TO COME Cohen says prosecutors in New York are investigating conversations that Trump or his advisers had with Cohen after the FBI raided his hotel room and office in April 2018. About two months later, Cohen says he had contact with Trump or one of his representatives. But Cohen declined to say more because he says the U.S. Attorney’s office in the Southern District of New York is investigating the matter. Cohen has pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations, lying to Congress and other offenses. He’s been cooperating with prosecutors and is expected to begin a three-year prison sentence in May. ENTANGLING THE TRUMP CHILDREN Trump’s children emerged as key figures in a plan to build a Trump Tower in Moscow and as their father’s top defenders. Cohen said he had briefed Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. approximately 10 times about the business deal. Cohen’s testimony may pose a problem for Trump Jr., who told Congress in 2017 that was only “peripherally aware” of the proposal. During Wednesday’s testimony, Trump Jr. ridiculed Cohen as a disgruntled former employee who was just out to save himself. Trump Jr. tweeted that Cohen’s testimony sounded “like a breakup letter.” Both he and his brother, Eric Trump, suggested that Cohen was angry because he was rejected from a job at the White House — an assertion Cohen denied. Eric Trump also tweeted a Republican Party video about Cohen with the title, “Have Fun in Prison!” ___ Follow all of AP’s Trump Investigations coverage at https://apnews.com/TrumpInvestigations Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

I’m going to show you who’s boss.’ It’s just no way to run a railroad.” Weld said he believed his path forward in taking on Trump ― who polls show enjoys close to unanimous support among Republican voters ― hinged on drawing awareness to the administration’s “reckless” spending. Though financial prudence traditionally has been a core GOP principle, the federal budget deficit continued to rise in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and is on pace to top $1 trillion for the year. The national debt also hit $22 trillion for first time ever last week. Weld, who server as governor from 1991-97, said he also would focus his campaign on education and the potentially negative impact of artificial intelligence and robotics on the workforce. “That’s the sort of thing they’re not paying attention to in Washington, because they’re so busy with divisiveness and trying to make everyone feel awful,” he said. Weld’s announcement in New Hampshire of his exploratory committee drew criticism from the chairman of the Massachusetts Republican Party, Jim Lyons. He noted that aside from Weld’s vice presidential bid as a Libertarian, the former governor endorsed Democrat Barack Obama over Republican John McCain in the 2008 White House race. “After abandoning Republicans, Democrats and Libertarians, Weld demands that faithful Republicans consider him as their standard-bearer. Even Benedict Arnold switched allegiances less often!” Lyons said in a statement. Weld dismissed such criticisms in his Sunday comments. He claimed that Republicans like Lyons are “all under pressure and orders from Washington” to ensure Trump is nominated “without anyone having to think or analyze issues.”.

SAN SALVADOR/TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - The United States suspended a meeting with Central American officials that was to take place this week, the government of El Salvador said, as the policies of U.S. President Donald Trump test relations in the region. In a statement issued late Saturday, the El Salvadoran government said it regretted that U.S. officials had called off the meeting scheduled in Washington among members of the Alliance for Prosperity, a U.S.-led group that seeks to boost economic growth in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. El Salvadoran officials said they were notified of the meeting’s cancellation on Friday and would be willing to meet in the future. “El Salvador is ready to participate and waiting for this conference to be rescheduled,” officials said in the statement. The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. José Isaías Barahona, Honduras’ deputy foreign minister, said the meeting was cancelled due to scheduling conflicts. “Surely when schedules line up, El Salvador, along with Honduras and Guatemala, will attend the meetings of the Alliance for Prosperity,” he said in an interview. Marta Larra, a spokeswoman for the Guatemalan foreign ministry, said she had been informed that the meeting had been postponed because the dates did not work well for the Central American countries. Citing U.S. officials, the Washington Post reported on Saturday that the meeting was cancelled after representatives from El Salvador and Guatemala said they would not send envoys. But El Salvador said it was planning to attend and did not know why the meeting had been halted. “We reiterate our willingness to strengthen the Alliance for Prosperity,” the government said. Launched in 2014, the Alliance for Prosperity was a U.S. bid to curb migration from the “Northern Triangle” of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras by strengthening economic growth and funding security programs. But U.S. and Central American officials have clashed in recent months. Many Central American families were affected by the U.S. government’s policy earlier this year of separating migrant children and parents at the border, and governments in the region have demanded information from the United States as they seek to reunite families. On Friday, the United States said it had recalled its top diplomats in El Salvador, along with the Dominican Republic and Panama, over those countries’ decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan.

{"global_context": "Trump loves a good fight more than anything else. And his opponents are either unwilling or unable to get on his level. Get the Think newsletter. It’s campaign season in America and that means that President Donald Trump is out stumping for candidates across the country ahead of this fall’s mid-term elections. These campaign rallies are the president’s favorite outlet: they’re unscripted, freewheeling streams of consciousness that give both the audience in the room, the press on the riser and his opponents at home what they’re looking for. There’s something for everyone. To paraphrase his ghost-written 1987 book \"The Art of the Deal,\" Donald Trump gets up every day ready to face whatever comes at him. He doesn’t think about yesterday and he doesn’t worry about tomorrow. The fight before him is what he is focused on. On June 20, the president signed an executive order ostensibly ending the practice of separating undocumented children and parents after crossing the border into the United States. It was a rare half-step backward for a man whose entire ethos is designed around forward momentum. (Which direction forward might be on a given day is anyone’s guess.) Why the semi-reversal was so stunning was not because Trump signed the order, however, but because of the level of external noise it took to even get him to notice that he had a political problem on his hands. He was so immersed in the fight that it took a massive effort to break through and force him to see he was actually losing it. This is what those who oppose him are unwilling or unable to understand. Like a legal scholar arguing an arcane point of case law or the theologian who revels in Talmudic debate, Trump is happiest amid conflict. Both borne of his father’s reputation and his tutelage at the knee of Roy Cohn, one of the all-time bare-knuckle fighters, Trump is nothing without someone to fight. His supporters love him for it. His opponents try and fail to emulate it. Whether it was Senator Marco Rubio’s (R-Florida) ham-handed attempts to “go Trump” during the 2016 Republican presidential primary or the recent outburst by California Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA), attempts at matching his volume and vitriol inevitably backfire. The truth is, Trump is willing and able to say things that would make the average person blanch and the average politician pass out. Others cannot imitate his act because for the president, it isn’t an act at all. When Maxine Waters got behind a microphone and says activists should chase around Trump administration officials while eating dinner, the political and chattering classes (of both parties) roundly criticized her for inciting violence and not preaching “civility.\" When Trump goes to Minnesota or South Carolina and calls immigrants killers and rapists, the attendant outrage is impotent. Why does Trump get away with it when others don’t? For several reasons. First, many celebrities and political candidates with long and sordid backgrounds enjoy a discount rate on their bad behavior. What are you going to say about Trump that hasn’t already been said? His antics are baked into the cake of how he’s perceived by the public. Next, a good portion of the electorate likely believes what the president is saying, even if they don’t like the way he’s saying it. That support and the support of a cowed Republican Congress allows the president leeway to say things without immediate political consequences. The next test comes in November when the nation will see whether the president’s words and deeds have an electoral consequence. But repudiation is not a forgone conclusion. In fact, it will take the president’s opponents, both from the left and right, an inordinate amount of time, work and energy to communicate to voters that what we daily see and hear from our chief executive is not normal, nor healthy for the Republic. With the announcement of Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement, Trump and his supporters are gearing up for yet another battle — one as consequential as any election, and perhaps more so. With the announcement of Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement, Trump and his supporters are gearing up for yet another battle — one as consequential as any election, and perhaps more so. So when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell deploys all the legislative tools at his disposal to ensure a speedy confirmation for the nation’s next Supreme Court justice, Trump will provide the complementary artillery fire. Though he rarely seems to understand the import of his actions, the president seems keenly aware of how rare it is to name a second justice to the highest court in the land in just two years. Perhaps it’s the fact that the appointment is lifetime in nature, feeding Trump’s ideals of everlasting power. Or perhaps it’s because the very name of the institution and its stark authority over deciding matters of law that captivates the president. The president’s opponents will likely attempt to frighten Americans and enrage voters with dystopian predictions of what another conservative on the court means for their core issues. Trump neither understands nor cares about these arguments and will call them every name in the book as he defends his eventual nominee. But like the situation at the border, or November’s looming elections — and no matter the outcome — picking the country’s next lifetime appointee will give Trump what he truly loves: a fight.

JOHANNESBURG — A U.S. military airstrike has killed 18 al-Shabab extremists after U.S. and local forces on the ground came under attack in southern Somalia, the U.S. Africa Command said Saturday. No U.S. or Somali forces were killed or injured in the attack, an AFRICOM spokesman, Nate Herring, told The Associated Press. The airstrike was carried out Friday in self-defense after extremists were \"observed maneuvering on a combined patrol,\" while the U.S. also responded with \"indirect fire,\" the spokesman said. The confrontation occurred about 31 miles northwest of the port city of Kismayo, the U.S. Africa Command statement said. Two other al-Shabab extremists were killed by Somali forces \"with small arms fire during the engagement,\" it said. The operation was Somali-led, the AFRICOM spokesman said. There was no immediate comment from Somali authorities. Al-Shabab fighters stand in formation with their weapons during military exercises on the outskirts of Mogadishu, Somalia on Feb. 17, 2011. Mohamed Sheikh Nor / AP, file The U.S. has carried out more than 20 airstrikes this year against the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab, the deadliest Islamic extremist group in sub-Saharan Africa. U.S. military involvement in Somalia has grown since President Donald Trump early in his term approved expanded operations against al-Shabab. Dozens of drone strikes followed. Late last year the military also carried out its first airstrike against a small presence of fighters linked to the Islamic State in northern Somalia. Since the expanded operations, two U.S. military personnel have been killed in Somalia. A service member was killed in May 2017 during an operation about 40 miles west of Mogadishu. And in June, one U.S. special operations soldier was killed and four U.S. service members wounded in an \"enemy attack\" as troops with Somali and Kenyan forces came under mortar and small-arms fire in Jubaland. The U.S. currently has about 500 military personnel in the Horn of Africa nation. Al-Shabab, which seeks to establish an Islamic state in Somalia, was pushed out of Mogadishu in recent years but continues to control rural areas in the south and central regions. Its fighters continue to attack the bases of a multinational African Union force that remains largely responsible for security as Somalia's fragile central government tries to recover from decades of chaos. In the next few years Somali forces are expected to take over responsibility for the country's security as the AU force withdraws. Concerns about their readiness remain high, and the U.N.

Margaritis Schinas declined, however, to confirm to reporters that, as the British government and EU officials have said, a draft treaty had been agreed by civil servants.

{"global_context": "Vandals Hit Ben Carson's House: He Urges Reconciliation To Oppose Racism. Vandals posted “hateful rhetoric” about President Donald Trump on a Virginia house owned by Housing Secretary Ben Carson. In response, Carson is urging Americans to avoid the emotional conflicts caused by the far-left effort to tear down Confederate-era memorials. advertisement Racist “hatred and bigotry unfortunately still exists in our country and we must all continue to fight it, but let’s use the right tools,” such as “people taking the high road,” he wrote. Reconciliation “is the likely outcome if we just learn to be neighborly and to get to know each other,” Carson wrote in an August 16 post on his Facebook page. In the post, he wrote: Our home in Virginia along with that of a neighbor was vandalized by people who also wrote hateful rhetoric about President Trump. We were out of town, but other kind, embarrassed neighbors cleaned up most of the mess before we returned. Before the vandalization of his Virginia home, he and his wife had bought a house in rural Maryland, Carson said. He continued: Several years ago we bought a farm in rural Maryland. One of the neighbors immediately put up a Confederate flag. A friend of ours who is an African-American three-star general was coming to visit and immediately turned around concluding that he was in the wrong place. Interestingly, all the other neighbors immediately put up American flags shaming the other neighbor who [later] took down the Confederate flag. [Just like in the Virginia vandalization] less than kind behavior was met by people taking the high road. We could all learn from these examples. Hatred and bigotry unfortunately still exists in our country and we must all continue to fight it, but let’s use the right tools. By the way, that neighbor who put up the Confederate flag subsequently became friendly. That is the likely outcome if we just learn to be neighborly and to get to know each other. On August 12, Carson commended Trump’s criticism of the white-power fascists and the progressive street fighters for brawling in Charlottesville. He wrote: Let us pray for those killed and injured during the unrest in Charlottesville today, but also for our nation as it is being severely threatened by hatred and bigotry on all sides. I am pleased that the President overtly disavowed any relationship with white supremacists. We should all reject the forces of division on all sides of the political spectrum. There are radical terrorists in the world who want to destroy us and are coming dangerously close to acquiring the means to accomplish their goals. We must present a strong and united front in the future. If America is going to survive, we must not yield to the forces of evil. Remember what our money says: “In God We Trust.” Let’s act accordingly. On August 13, just as Democrats slammed Trump for criticizing both brawling political factions, Carson wrote on Facebook: It is sad watching the political pundits arguing about whether President Trump went far enough in condemning the instigators of the violence in Charlottesville .

{"global_context": "The tweet that caused an uproar that led to the cancellation of Roseanne Barr’s ABC sitcom was a reminder of the most illuminating and depressing reality of our time: the stubborn centrality of race and racism in our national life. It has been more than half a century since Congress passed the landmark Civil Rights Act, which Americans of that era assumed would set the nation on the road to confronting and eliminating the blight of discrimination and prejudice. But this year, a major network provided a weekly platform to an entertainer who once referred to Susan Rice, President Barack Obama’s national security adviser, as “a man with big swinging ape (testicles).” ABC should have known what it was getting with Barr, whose show it dropped after she likened Valerie Jarrett, another black Obama aide, to an ape. But the network had been willing to overlook her nasty side in hopes of appealing to those forgotten souls who voted for Donald Trump. Rice and Jarrett are Stanford alumni with enviable records of academic and professional achievement who have served their country in high positions of trust. Yet the only trait that appears to matter to Barr, a high school dropout, is that they are African-American, which to her means they are more like beasts than humans. When the civil rights laws were enacted, it was common for whites to use the N-word. Even Lyndon Johnson, who pushed these measures through a Congress riddled with segregationists, was known to use it. Today, the epithet is heard far less among whites. But many who know better than to be so frank in their contempt for blacks find other ways to convey it. Obama himself got this treatment so often that the website The Awl published “A Guide to Racist Obama Monkey Photoshops.” Trump’s New York campaign co-chair told a reporter that Michelle Obama should be sent to “the outback of Zimbabwe” to live “in a cave with Maxie the gorilla.” The essence of these comments is that no matter how much intelligence, education, money or renown an African-American has, he or she can never be the equal of a white person. That prejudice has persisted despite being disowned by our laws and rejected by most whites. Last year, a National Opinion Research Center poll found that 26 percent of Republicans think blacks are less intelligent than whites — as do 18 percent of Democrats. To be an African-American is to be endlessly subjected to assumptions of inferiority. Obama’s election to the presidency appeared to mark a historic achievement, entrusting the most powerful job on the planet to a black man. But it also turned out to be a powerful goad to white fear and anger. Trump’s success would have been impossible without Obama, who was especially threatening to bigots not because he and his wife resembled the racist stereotype but because they refuted it so thoroughly. Over and over, Trump has voiced and encouraged distrust of blacks, from demanding the death penalty for the teenagers wrongly convicted in a 1989 Central Park rape to questioning whether Obama was born in the United States and whether he was qualified for admission to his Ivy League alma maters. Trump’s prejudice is not limited to blacks; Hispanics and Muslims are included. In the 2016 election, race was a central factor. Whites in every age group preferred Trump to Hillary Clinton, according to CNN’s exit poll. Several studies indicate that racism was his ally. “Racial resentment, anti-Muslim attitudes, and white identity were all much stronger predictors of support for Trump in the 2016 primaries than they were for prior Republican nominees,” wrote Michael Tesler, a political scientist at the University of California at Irvine. “Racially resentful whites without a college degree were most likely to flee the Democratic Party during Obama’s presidency.” Obama’s election raised hopes that Americans could finally overcome the racial enmities and tensions of the past. “His talent was to project an idealized vision of a post-racial America,” wrote Hoover Institution scholar Shelby Steele in 2008. But despite his caution on the issue, Obama’s presence in the White House roused deep anxieties among many white voters. Those anxieties have manifested themselves in overt white nationalism, anti-immigrant furies, the rise of Trump and the popularity of “Roseanne.” Many whites have long thought of our race problem as a national disease that will eventually be cured. But maybe it’s a permanent affliction that we can only hope to manage.

{"global_context": "Gina Haspel’s path to confirmation to be CIA director is facing turbulence in the Senate as questions about her background continue to go unanswered. The Senate Intelligence Committee scheduled a hearing to consider her nomination for May 9, prompting protest from two members on the committee who have been requesting information pertaining to Haspel’s career be declassified. “The American people expect and deserve to understand the backgrounds of their government’s leaders, and without further declassification, I don’t believe the Senate Intelligence Committee or the Senate as a whole can properly fulfill its constitutional obligation to ‘advise and consent’ on her nomination,” said Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., in a statement. Haspel's hearings will come in the wake of the rocky nomination of the current CIA director, Mike Pompeo, to become secretary of state. Pompeo's confirmation votes are expected next week. Some members of the Intelligence Committee are not satisfied with Haspel’s response to questions from Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the one-time prisoner of war who has opposed policies and nominees that supported harsh interrogations. McCain has asked Haspel 13 questions to clarify her role in administering “enhanced interrogations” to detainees. Aides say there is a classified version of Haspel’s response and an unclassified version, neither of which have been released. Haspel has begun meeting with senators individually ahead of her hearing, but Democrats say that the lack of transparency regarding her experience is problematic. While members of the Intelligence Committee have access to classified information, they are unable to talk about it and the public can't see it. “There have been too many problems too soon,” said a Democratic Senate aide who is not authorized to speak publicly. Democrats have launched a campaign to try and persuade the CIA to declassify some of the information about her career. “She’s a career CIA officer, there is zero chance in hell you’re going to be able to declassify her entire work history. But the torture stuff shouldn’t be a heavy lift,” said another Democratic aide to a Senate Intelligence Committee who asked not to be named in order to speak frankly. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has already announced his opposition, and with the narrow Republican majority, 51-49, Haspel can’t afford to lose more Republicans — or she’ll have to gain the support of Democrats who are more opposed to Trump's nominees as the administration ages and controversy continues with Trump's cabinet picks and as special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation drags on. While Paul and McCain are the only two GOP senators to make their concerns public, others have privately expressed reservations about her nominations. One senior administration official acknowledged that there is concern about Haspel being able to pass through the Senate, but the official blamed Democrats, calling their concern based on “pure politics.” Gina Haspel speaks at the William J. Donovan Award Dinner, Oct. 2017. The OSS Society / via YouTube Haspel’s nomination has revived a debate from the Bush administration era where anti-war groups multiplied and Democrats ran on anti-war and anti-torture platforms. Now, a coalition of groups are pressuring senators to oppose her. A group of 50 elected officials and community leaders in Virginia wrote a letter urging their senators, Mark Warner, ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, and Tim Kaine, to oppose her nomination. And 40 progressive, faith and libertarian groups signed a letter to every senator expressing similar opposition to Haspel. “No matter what Ms. Haspel says during a hearing, any vote related to her nomination (whether in committee or on the Senate floor) will be seen as a referendum on torture — by the public, by U.S. allies and enemies, and perhaps most alarmingly by the president, who has openly advocated for torture,” the letter states. Marc Short, White House director of legislative affairs, says Haspel is prepared for a potentially contentious confirmation hearing. \"I think she understands the political dynamics, but I think when you’ve been a station chief in places across the world, this isn’t what makes you nervous.” Current and former CIA officials say Haspel arrived to take the helm at the prison after its most famous detainee, Abu Zubeydah, was waterboarded in a manner so horrific, according to a Senate report, that it reduced some CIA personnel to tears. She was present for the interrogation of Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, who was suspected of involvement in the bombing of the USS Cole destroyer in 2000, which killed 17 sailors. According to a 2014 Senate report, Nashiri was waterboarded, subjected to sleep deprivation and confined inside a coffin for days — three of the techniques approved by Justice Department lawyers. He was also subjected to unapproved techniques, including a mock execution by an interrogator who racked the slide of a pistol as if preparing to fire and then revved a power drill next to his head, the report said. There is much that has not been made public about Haspel’s exact role, and some senators are pushing to declassify documents that would shed light on it. Another point of controversy is her role in the destruction of the videotapes of the Thailand interrogations. That came later, in 2005, when she was working at CIA headquarters as the chief of staff to the director of operations, Jose Rodriguez.

Jeremy Hunt has called on Boris Johnson not to be a “coward” by avoiding a live TV debate with him this week as the Tory leadership race turned personal. Hunt suggested dodging a Sky News head-to-head would risk his rival “slinking through the back door” of Number 10 as Johnson remained under pressure to explain why police were called to the home he shares with partner Carrie Symonds, Foreign Secretary Hunt has previously attacked Johnson over reports he was “bottling” a live TV debate before postal ballots are returned. In his column for the Daily Telegraph, Johnson attempted to switch attention back to political rather than personal issues as he repeated his determination to deliver Brexit by Halloween. Stepping up pressure on his rival, Hunt insisted that while he has no interest in debating Johnson’s private life, he wants to challenge him on television over his commitment to taking the UK out of the EU by the end of October. In an article in The Times, Hunt said: “A new prime minister needs the legitimacy of having made his arguments publicly and having them subjected to scrutiny. “Only then can you walk through the front door of No 10 with your head held high instead of slinking through the back door, which is what Boris appears to want.” He added: “Don’t be a coward Boris, man up and show the nation you can cope with the intense scrutiny the most difficult job in the country will involve.” Hunt said on Sunday that he thought any candidate for prime minister “should answer questions on everything”. Meanwhile, Johnson wrote in the Telegraph: “We must leave the EU on Oct 31 come what may. It will honour the referendum result, it will focus the minds of EU negotiators.” He added: “It is absolutely vital that we keep our eyes on the prize. It has been a long and parching march – but the oasis is finally in sight. “We are just over four months away from the date on which, by law, we must leave the EU; and this time we are not going to bottle it. We are not going to fail. “This time we are not going to shrink in fear from the exit, as we have on the last two occasions.” This is what I was writing about this morning. It's rubbish.

Hunt told Sky News: “I think someone who wants to be prime minister should answer questions on everything. “But I’m not going to comment on issues of character because … I am sure you and I have got things, that, you know, we would be embarrassed if they came out. “I just think it’s irrelevant given the gravity of the situation. I am not going to comment on Boris’s personal life. That’s for others to make their judgments on.” The Foreign Secretary insisted his predecessor in the Cabinet role was trying to avoid scrutiny in the battle for Number 10. “What Boris needs to do is engage properly in this leadership debate. “This is an audition to be the prime minister of the United Kingdom and Boris needs to show that he is prepared to answer difficult questions.” Hunt supporter and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox signalled it was better to be clear about what had happened. Dr Fox told BBC1’s The Andrew Marr Show: “I think it is always easier to just give an explanation.” He added: “It is inevitable there is a focus on private lives. That does not concern me. What I am concerned about are the issues.” Johnson repeatedly refused to explain to Tory grassroots at a Saturday hustings what went on at the south London flat in the early hours of Friday morning, saying the party faithful did not want “to hear about that kind of thing”. Johnson’s campaign for Number 10 was rocked by the revelations that officers were called to the home he shares with partner Symonds by a neighbour who claimed to have been “frightened and concerned” after hearing shouting, “a loud scream” and banging coming from the property. A poll carried out after the reports emerged suggested Johnson’s support among Tory voters had dropped by more than half while among the general electorate it indicated he had slipped into second place behind rival Hunt. PA Wire/PA Images At the hustings, moderator Iain Dale drew heckles from some in the crowd when he asked Johnson whether a person’s private life had any bearing on someone’s ability to discharge the office of prime minister. “Don’t boo the great man,” Johnson said, but Dale suggested he was “completely avoiding” the question. On Saturday night, the neighbour who rang the Metropolitan Police went public after suggestions that his recording of the row had been leaked to The Guardian with political intent. Tom Penn said the allegations were “bizarre and fictitious”, explaining in a statement to the paper that he dialled 999 after hearing shouting coming from his neighbour’s flat. “It was loud enough and angry enough that I felt frightened and concerned for the welfare of those involved, so I went inside my own home, closed the door, and pressed record on the voice memos app on my phone,” the 29-year-old playwright said. “After a loud scream and banging, followed by silence, I ran upstairs, and with my wife agreed that we should check on our neighbours. “I knocked three times at their front door, but there was no response.

James Comey, the FBI director fired by President Donald Trump last year, testified Friday behind closed doors to a Republican-led congressional committee looking into Hillary Clinton’s emails. Comey agreed to submit to the deposition before the House oversight committee in a deal settling his legal challenge of a subpoena in exchange for the public release of the full transcript of his testimony. The committee agreed to give the transcript to Comey within 24 hours. Republican lawmakers were frustrated with the proceedings, complaining that Comey didn’t give satisfactory answers to their questions. Rep.

Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) a member of the committee, said he had 14 pages of questions for Comey. He told CNN ahead of the hearing that he didn’t want Comey to testify in public because “we would be giving him a pass that I don’t think he deserves.” Trump, who fired Comey in May 2017 after the FBI began investigating whether the Trump campaign had a role in Russian election interference, renewed his Twitter attacks on Comey Friday in anticipation of the testimony. The president also took a swipe at special counsel Robert Mueller, who now heads the investigation that has ensnared many of Trump’s closest allies. “Robert Mueller and Leakin’ Lyin’ James Comey are Best Friends, just one of many Mueller Conflicts of Interest,” Trump tweeted.

{"global_context": "The Republican Party is finally realizing what the Libertarian Party has known for decades: California is best when the voters have options. Jessica Millan Patterson, Chair of the California Republican Party, recently wrote, “Republicans have both an opportunity and a responsibility to stand up and offer a viable alternative to the Democrats and give voters a real choice.” However, other Republican leaders feel that the GOP isn’t the option Californians are looking for. Soon after last year’s general election, Kristin Olsen, former Assembly Republican leader and current Stanislaus County Supervisor, wrote “the California Republican Party isn’t salvageable at this time. The Grand Old Party is dead.” So which is it? What has been the cause of the Republican Party’s apparent demise in the state? Perhaps it is because they concentrate on issues that are either irrelevant for or antithetical to Californians. Perhaps it is because the party seems to have abandoned its former regard for limited government in order to appease a president that is wildly unpopular in this state. Perhaps it is because they also seem to be doing a good job of identifying problems in the state but aren’t coming up with solutions. The middle class is struggling in the state as they are burdened with the highest taxes and most stringent regulations in the country. As a result businesses are fleeing the state and taking with them high paying jobs that could benefit many Californians. In addition to jobs leaving the state, living here has become more expensive; we have a huge shortage of affordable housing. And last, but certainly not least, we have an out of control public employee pension system; these pension liabilities are unsustainable and will ultimately bankrupt local municipalities and the state itself. To solve the problems of California, we need to stop the unsustainable spending. California legislators need to learn to spend within the state’s means rather than raising taxes on the top income earners who will continue to leave the state and take with them their tax dollars. The Libertarian Party believes the first step is to reduce the many regulations that have forced so many businesses to find a more business friendly environment. The housing crisis could be alleviated by reducing the hurdles in place to build affordable housing. A few simple steps we can take could help millions of people in the state. And finally, the first step to handling the state’s pension debt is to renegotiate the contracts with the public employee unions. As an example, when Jeff Hewitt was mayor of Calimesa, his city withdrew from their contract with CalFire and instead created their own fire department whose employees are enrolled in a traditional 401K retirement system; this simple step will keep the city from ultimate bankruptcy. This approach needs to be taken throughout the state. In the last election season California Republicans lost seats in both state houses as well as representation in Washington. Between January 2018 and February 2019 the number of registered Republicans decreased by 2.5 percent while registered Libertarians increased 9.5 percent. Libertarians had a huge win in Riverside County when Jeff Hewitt was elected 5th District Supervisor over the Republican candidate, Russ Bogh, a former state assembly person with the deep pockets of the public employee unions behind him. The Libertarian Party also ran candidates for state assembly seats in districts where Republicans didn’t even field a candidate. I was one of those candidates; in the 70th Assembly District I was the first Libertarian candidate to progress to the general election in a contested primary coming in ahead of Democratic and Green Party candidates to face off against the Democratic incumbent.

What does this mean? It means that Californians are looking for real change in the state. I think that the Libertarian Party offers much of this change, but I also believe in working with others when there’s common ground. When I ran for office I said the beauty of electing a Libertarian is there are often times we can work with people on both sides of the traditional “aisle,” and I believe this more now than ever.

Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl-winning New England Patriots, joined President Trump, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and their wives for dinner on Friday, Feb. 10 at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla. (Reuters) Earlier this year, three watchdog groups made a formal public-records request for all “presidential visitors” at Mar-a-Lago, President Trump's busy Palm Beach social club where he has stayed seven times this year. When the government didn't respond, the groups sued. On Friday, the U.S. government provided its official answer: The list had just 22 names, all from the same group of visitors: a delegation of Japanese officials and assistants who accompanied Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on a February stay at Trump's resort. The list included several high-ranking officials who might actually have met with the president: the Japanese national security adviser, the Japanese ambassador to the United States and a deputy foreign minister. But it also included several visitors with less-glamorous roles, including the prime minister's butler and three luggage carriers. The list also included two men with non-Japanese names, who were described as van drivers. They were all contained in a single email from a U.S. State Department official to the Secret Service, asking them to allow these 22 people onto Mar-a-Lago grounds during Abe's visit. Of course, that's not the full list of visitors to Mar-a-Lago. Many hundreds of other people entered the club during the days when the president was there. They included club members: Initiation now costs $200,000. Nonmembers, who came for one of the charity galas in the club's ballrooms. Members' friends, who joined them on the dining terrace. Chinese officials, including President Xi Jinping, who famously shared “the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake” (in Trump's words) with the president at the club while U.S. Navy ships were preparing to launch missiles at military installations in Syria. None of those names were released. The Justice Department, which responded to the request, said the government didn't have to give them. “The remaining records [of visitors] contain, reflect, or otherwise relate to the President’s schedules. The government believes that Presidential schedule information is not subject to” a Freedom of Information Act request, said a letter from two top Justice Department officials, which the watchdog group released Friday. The watchdog groups were already suing the Department of Homeland Security — which includes the Secret Service — for failure to release visitor logs at both the White House and Mar-a-Lago. Jordan Libowitz, spokesman for the group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said it would ask a federal judge to compel the government to release more. “This is nowhere near transparency,” Libowitz said. “This is an insult to people who expect … that the American people deserve to know who is meeting the president.” The other two groups are the Knight First Amendment Institute and the National Security Archive. The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Washington Post. The Trump administration has not released any details about visitors to the White House. The Obama administration did release its logs, after a series of lawsuits from Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.

{"global_context": "Two years after presidential primaries laid bare divisions in the Democratic Party, its voters remain in a muddle over whom they favor in the 2020 election, torn between a trio of veterans but unattached at this point to any of a fresh generation of potential candidates, a new USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll has found. Hillary Clinton, the 2016 nominee who has said repeatedly that she will not run for president again, ranked third among those planning to cast ballots in the Democratic primary with 19%, suggesting little in the way of a groundswell for a third campaign. She trailed former Vice President Joe Biden, at 28%, and was virtually tied with her 2016 challenger, independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, at 22%. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was favored by 11%, and a host of additional candidates were all in single digits. “Democrats have moved on from Clinton,” said Robert Shrum, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at USC, which co-sponsored the poll. He attributed much of Biden’s and Sanders’ strength to being well known. “Those numbers actually indicate an appetite for something new,” he said. On the GOP side, meanwhile, President Trump’s troubled tenure has cut into what would ordinarily be nearly unanimous support among those planning to cast Republican primary ballots. While 75% of Republicans said they planned to vote to renominate the president, the remaining quarter of the vote said they favored someone else, a high level of dissent for an incumbent within his own party. The figure was particularly striking as it comes at the end of Trump’s first year in office, when a typical president would still be in honeymoon mode. “These are like Carter reelect numbers,” said Republican strategist Mike Murphy, a consultant to the poll and a longtime critic of Trump, referring to the 1980 election which Jimmy Carter lost. “He’s got a real hole in his numbers.” On both sides the results reflected party schisms. Democrats have moved to the left since the 2016 primaries, but some in the party worry that that will complicate efforts to pick up — or protect — seats in more conservative areas. Republicans, meanwhile, are struggling to maintain their hold on voters who have led them to control of the House and Senate, even as the party is taken over by Trumpian forces bent on reversing long-held GOP positions on foreign policy, trade and immigration. How this poll was conducted » Democrats are riding anger at Trump into substantial gains going into the 2018 elections and benefiting from unity against the unpopular president. But there is little unity when it comes to who should win the presidential primaries that will begin in two years. Biden, who is 75, considered running in 2016 but passed after the death of his son, Beau. Now on a book tour, he has left open the question of whether he will seek the presidency in 2020 for what would be the third time. (He ran in 1988 and 2008.) He currently has a lead among most key groups, the poll found. He was ahead among white Americans and those living in the Northeast and Midwest. He also led among self-identified Democrats and had a nominal lead, within the poll’s margin of error, among independents. While his lead is broad, it is not large and certainly far from establishing him as a prohibitive favorite. Sanders, who is 76, was ahead among young Americans, carrying 34% of those under 35. Those voters represented his strongest asset in his surprisingly strong showing in 2016. Clinton, who is 70, also held on to her strongest supporters, favored by 36% of African Americans and a plurality of those with annual incomes below $25,000. As she did in 2016, Clinton scored better among women — with 22% support — than men —15%. While she came in second to Biden among women, she was behind both Biden and Sanders among men. Those three well-known politicians as a group carried nearly seven in 10 voters, with the remainder scattered among other candidates. Sen. Kamala Harris of California was selected by 5% of voters, less than half of Warren’s 11%. Rep. Joseph Kennedy of Massachusetts was favored by 4%, and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey was named by 3%. The results were a reminder that even in a period of heightened public interest in politics, it remains a steep task to become well known as a candidate for the highest office in the land. “There is a market for a new candidate — who has yet to be announced or picked,” Democratic strategist Douglas Herman, a poll consultant, said of the field arrayed below Biden, Sanders and Clinton. “There’s just no knowledge of who these folks are among voters at large.” Trump, of course, is well known by almost everyone — and that is part of the problem. While he is the titular head of the Republican Party, his handling of the presidency has markedly cut into the support any incumbent president would want to achieve heading into a reelection campaign. Trump retains higher levels of support among the groups who were most loyal to him in 2016: 86% of those with high school educations said they planned to vote for Trump, as did 80% of both white evangelicals and those age 65 and older. Rural voters, who were largely responsible for unexpectedly strong Trump showings in several states in the industrial Midwest, also remained loyal, with 82% saying they would vote for Trump. He has lost ground, however, among other groups important to his victory. Only 57% of those with college degrees backed Trump in the USC/Times poll, a strikingly low percentage and a reflection of sagging support in suburban areas that punished Republican candidates in 2017 races. Among independents who planned to vote in the Republican primary, 65% backed Trump — again a sign of difficulty for Trump’s reelection effort. ", "label": "positive", "local_context": "Sen.

{"global_context": "The most promising criminal justice reform effort at the federal level in some time is on hold after President Trump decided the matter was too contentious to take up before the midterm elections. The First Step Act, which has drawn bipartisan support, seeks to expand federal prison rehabilitation programs, increase opportunities for inmates to earn good-time credits for release and would include modest but important sentencing reforms. Such reforms are necessary given the high rate of recidivism among federal prisoners — about half of those released in 2005 were rearrested within eight years — and the reality that simply imprisoning people doesn’t translate to improved outcomes. “Prisons may exacerbate recidivism,” notes the National Institute of Justice, the research arm of the U.S. Department of Justice. “Research has found evidence that prison can exacerbate, not reduce, recidivism. Prisons themselves may be schools for learning to commit crimes.” The First Step Act is just what its name suggests, a first step toward rebalancing the criminal justice system with evidence-based approaches. While the Aug. 3 decision, as reported by Axios, to postpone consideration of the act until after the midterms is a setback, there are many causes for optimism. One is the president’s consistent recognition of the importance of criminal justice reform. For all of his tough-on-crime rhetoric, President Trump has actually been quite vocal in his support for prison reform and giving formerly incarcerated people a second chance. “As America regains its strength, this opportunity must be extended to all citizens,” Trump said in his State of the Union Address. “That is why this year we will embark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance.” Second, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated his willingness to bring the bill for a vote in the Senate. Third, the bill continues to have widespread support. While some tough-on-crime Republicans like Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, have chosen to rely on scare tactics such as invoking Willie Horton, support for criminal justice reform among those on the right has grown significantly in recent years.

Time will tell. We urge the White House and members of Congress from across the political spectrum to set aside partisan considerations and push for a vote on the First Step Act this year.

{"global_context": "Ted Cruz is facing an increasingly powerful challenge from Democrat Beto O’Rourke, and even some Republicans are saying he faces a tough challenge. Other Republicans dispute any suggestion that Mr. Cruz could lose. Texas, they argue, is not going to send a Democrat to the Senate. Some of its biggest cities are largely Democratic, but the suburbs and rural areas remain Republican, and Democratic voters’ history of low turnout has helped Republicans maintain their grip on power. In the Republican presidential primary in 2016, Mr. Cruz easily won Texas, earning 43 percent of the vote compared to Mr. Trump’s 26 percent. “Ted Cruz is not in trouble,” said Allen E. Blakemore, a Republican political consultant and the senior strategist for one of the most powerful conservatives in the state, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick. “Texas is a reliably red state and is going to continue to be for the foreseeable future. There is not a single statewide race that is in jeopardy.” If Mr. Cruz is in the fight of his political life, it was hard to see on Tuesday. “I didn’t give it much thought,” he said Tuesday when asked about Mr. Mulvaney’s comments. “I’m focused on what the people of Texas say. And we’re seeing incredible energy, incredible enthusiasm.” Mr. Cruz said he has been approached by voters who say they are Democrats but are supporting Mr. Cruz now. “With the election of Donald Trump, national Democrats are just consumed by rage and fury, and they’re embracing extreme positions, like Beto O’Rourke saying he’s open to abolishing ICE, or Beto O’Rourke committing that he would vote ‘yes’ to impeach Donald Trump,” Mr. Cruz said. “I am energetically welcoming conservative Democrats, moderate Democrats, independents.” Mr. Cruz’s campaign is getting a boost soon from Mr. Trump, his rival for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. Mr. Trump announced on Twitter that he was coming to Texas in October to host a “major rally” for Mr. Cruz. Democrats see it as a sign that Mr. Cruz’s campaign is struggling and needs rescuing. The trip seemed, in part, to be a response to a meeting in July in Washington between Texas leaders and Mr. Trump’s political staff. The July 25 meeting at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building was attended by Mr. Patrick, who was the Texas chairman of Mr. Trump’s campaign in 2016. Mr. Patrick and others were seeking to encourage Mr. Trump to campaign in Texas, according to a person who attended the meeting, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the meeting. The idea was not for Mr. Trump to come to the aid of Mr. Cruz, but for the president to boost Republican turnout to help the races farther down the ballot, the person said. On the surface, the prospect of Mr. Cruz campaigning with the president seems remarkable. Mr. Trump nicknamed Mr. Cruz Lyin’ Ted during the 2016 campaign, and attacked both his wife and his father.

{"global_context": "California's state legislature blocked soda taxes this week after pressure from the beverage industry. The soda tax was meant to help fight obesity and diabetes. Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. A new push by the beverage industry is slowing the expansion of soda taxes in California and elsewhere. California cities pioneered soda taxes as a way to combat obesity, diabetes and heart disease, but the Legislature and Gov. Jerry Brown on Thursday bowed to pressure from beverage companies and reluctantly banned local taxes on soda for the next 12 years. It follows similar bans recently passed in Arizona and Michigan. Voters in Oregon will decide on a statewide ban in November. The American Beverage Association, which represents Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and others, has backed the moves after several cities passed taxes on sugary drinks in recent years. “I’ve been in politics a long time, and sometimes you have to do what’s necessary to avoid catastrophe.” California’s ban is part of a last-minute maneuver to block a beverage industry-backed ballot measure that would make it much harder for cities and counties to raise taxes of any kind. The ABA said in a statement the legislation is about keeping groceries, including drinks, affordable. Lawmakers approved the proposal despite deep reluctance. “This industry is aiming a nuclear weapon at government in California and saying, ‘If you don’t do what we want we are going to pull the trigger and you are not going to be able to fund basic government services,’” said Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat from San Francisco, which has a soda tax. Assemblyman Matthew Harper, R-Huntington Beach, sips a Coke as Assembly members debate a ban on local soda taxes, June 28, 2018, in Sacramento, California. Rich Pedroncelli / AP The Legislature’s action drew a strong rebuke from public health advocates who view soda taxes as a crucial front in their efforts to contain obesity and the health complications it causes. But local government officials, terrified by the prospect of having their hands tied on all future tax increases, reluctantly backed the legislation. “I’ve been in politics a long time, and sometimes you have to do what’s necessary to avoid catastrophe,” said Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg, who is pushing a local sales tax increase that would be at risk if the ballot measure passed. The governor said only a handful of communities are looking to tax soda, but the ballot measure would affect all 482 cities in California. “Mayors from countless cities have called to voice their alarm and to strongly support the compromise which this bill represents,” Brown wrote in a memo explaining his decision. The California measure bans any new taxes on groceries including beverages through 2030, but allows four cities in the San Francisco Bay Area to keep soda levies already on the books. The beverage industry has used aggressive campaigning to beat back soda taxes and other measures. But some soda tax efforts are now receiving better funding. Former New York City Michael Bloomberg, a billionaire who unsuccessfully tried to limit the size of sugary drinks sold in the city to 16 ounces, has funded some local efforts. Philadelphia, Seattle and Boulder, Colorado also have taxes on sugary drinks. After Brown signed the legislation, the California Business Roundtable withdrew a ballot measure that would have raised the threshold for any tax increases by local government. Nancy Brown, chief executive of the American Heart Association, asked for a meeting with Gov. Jerry Brown after The Sacramento Bee reported beverage industry lobbyists dined with Brown and his wife Anne Gust Brown at the governor’s mansion in Sacramento this month. A spokesman for Brown, Evan Westrup, said the governor did not negotiate the deal and the dinner was unrelated. Public health officials said taxes are the most effective tool they have to discourage people from drinking soda, sports drinks, sweetened coffee and tea, and other sugary beverages. Beverage companies spend billions promoting their products that public health professional can’t match, said Kristine Madsen, a physician and associate professor of public health at University of California, Berkeley. She led a study that found a 20 percent reduction in consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages in low-income neighborhoods in the year after the city’s tax took effect. Sales in grocery stores dropped 8 percent — a figure that was not fully offset by higher sales in neighboring towns.

{"global_context": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday declared that Congress is a “superior branch” of government, as the clash between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration over closely held documents intensifies. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday declared that Congress is a “superior branch” of government, as the clash between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration over closely held documents intensifies. During an interview with Robert Costa for Washington Post Live, Pelosi, D-Calif., was asked whether Congress is functioning as a coequal branch of government. NY TIMES REPORTS IT FOUND TRUMP TAX DOCS SHOWING NEARLY $1.2B IN LOSSES “I think we’re a superior branch, quite frankly,” Pelosi said. “We have the power to make the law and the president enforces the law. So we have a big role. We’re closest to the people and we have a big role to play.” Despite Pelosi’s opinion, the U.S. Constitution, in its first three articles, defines three separate, but equal, branches of government: legislative, executive and judicial. The separation of powers also creates a system of checks and balances to ensure all three branches are coequal. Pelosi's comments, though, come amid a battle between the White House and Congress over sensitive material—including files detailing Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation and President Trump’s tax returns. The House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed several Trump administration officials, including former White House Counsel Don McGahn, who featured prominently in the section of Mueller’s report on obstruction of justice. The White House has blocked McGahn from testifying before the committee and from turning over documents responsive to that subpoena, instead saying the committee should direct future requests for those documents to the White House. PELOSI: TRUMP IS 'GOADING US TO IMPEACH HIM' The committee is also locked in a battle with the Justice Department over their demands for not only Attorney General Bill Barr’s testimony but access to the full, unredacted Mueller report and underlying documents. The committee, on Wednesday, is slated to vote on whether to hold Barr in contempt for not handing over those files. The Justice Department is arguing, though, that the president could invoke executive privilege with regard to both Barr and the underlying evidence related to the Mueller report. Some Democrats have even suggested arresting Barr until he complies. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is fighting House Ways and Means Committee Democrats over their demands for the president’s personal tax returns. That clash intensified on Tuesday evening, when The New York Times obtained printouts of Trump’s IRS tax transcripts from 1985 to 1994. The documents revealed that the president claimed to have lost $1.17 billion from his real estate businesses for that time period. On Wednesday, Pelosi was asked if Mnuchin, too, could be arrested in order to force compliance with congressional requests for Trump’s tax returns. “We do have a jail in the basement of the Congress, but if we were arresting all of the people in the administration, we would have an overcrowded jail situation,” she said. “And I’m not for that.” Pelosi said that all committee decisions are “so law and precedent-based” and there are several options for committee chairmen going forward. Pelosi’s latest comments come after she claimed on Tuesday that the president was “goading” Democrats into impeachment. “I have said that the president wants to goad us into impeachment,” she said again Wednesday. “The point is, that every single day, whether it's obstruction, obstruction, obstruction of having people come to the table with facts, ignoring subpoenas every single day, the president is making a case. He’s becoming self-impeachable.”.

{"global_context": "Tim Draper, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, answers some questions about the ballot measure he championed, to split California into three separate states. Tim Draper is used to making waves. A third-generation Silicon Valley venture capitalist, Draper has a reputation as an eccentric entrepreneur. He was an early investor in tech companies that hit it big, including Skype. And he’s now one of the nation’s most ardent supporters of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Draper, an Atherton resident who turned 60 on Monday, has now ventured into something with potentially more power to disrupt: He’s successfully qualified a ballot initiative that will ask Californians in November to split the state into three new ones. His first effort — which called for six new California states — fizzled in 2014. On Tuesday, elections officials estimated that Draper had collected more than 402,468 valid signatures for his measure. That’s more than enough to be included on a November ballot that could see as many as 16 propositions by the deadline for certification later this month. The Times asked Draper about his motivations. What follows is an email Q&A, lightly edited for length and clarity. No doubt you know some believe this is an unserious proposal to the state’s serious problems. How would you respond? This arrogant dismissiveness represents the current state of corruption rampant in the halls of the bureaucracy in the Sacramento status quo. We have failing school systems, broken infrastructure with bad waterways and highways, and we have the highest taxes in the nation. There is no excuse for people not being open to a new solution ... [Critics] offer nothing but kneejerk rejection of discussion around one of the most meaningful initiatives to come through the ballot, ever! Who helped you determine where the three states’ boundaries would go? Was there a methodology used? Over the past year and a half, we have gone up and down the state of California and listened to what the voters are most concerned about ... They don’t feel effectively represented in Sacramento ... They want to feel like their state has a locally vested plan to help successfully educate their kids, deliver reliable roads and waterways and constantly work in the best interests of the community, all while maintaining that essential feeling of regional pride. Reflecting those priorities, the Cal-3 coalition recognized that three states, based on natural geography, population density and representation that prioritized support closer to home, had overwhelming support from Californians, and the statewide approval to put Cal-3 on the ballot is a testament to Cal-3’s commitment to delivering more meaningful results closer to home for all Californians. If Californians vote to split the state, here’s what would happen » Do you intend to fund the November campaign in a significant way, and can you offer any details on the level of money you’d spend? We expect to see significant financial support from all corners of California, just as we have seen signature support from citizens across that state to put this initiative on the ballot for the first time ever! ... One thing is for sure. I don’t want to have to leave this state, but I don’t want my grandchildren to have to live in the state that is near last in education, last in quality of life, last as a place to do business and last in taxes ... Now it is up to Californians. They have an unprecedented chance to really improve government in California, and they will get a chance to vote on [something] to truly make a difference in November. Is part of your goal to spark discussion about California’s future, rather than an actual three-state future? You may have thought this, but I am very straightforward here. I believe that the state needs to be refreshed, rebooted, and reinvigorated. The Cal 3 initiative would not have earned the support of so many across the state to earn a place on the ballot for the first time ever if the voters did not think a three-state future held real promise of meaningful solutions for all Californians. To be clear: The vote this November is just the first step toward greatness ... From there, we will need the U.S. Congress to approve our right to be three.

{"global_context": "Perhaps nothing will define our future politics more than the dispensation of Latino voters. Once limited to a few states, Latino voters are now an important and growing factor in many parts of the country beyond the Southwest or New York. Where are Latinos going? More than African-Americans, who tend to vote roughly 90 percent Democratic, Latinos have traditionally divided their votes, with roughly two in three generally supporting Democrats. Some Republican politicians, such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, George W. Bush, new Florida Sen. Rick Scott as well current Texas Gov. Greg Abbott have gotten over 40 percent support or higher. Right now, thanks in part to loutish remarks by President Trump, most Latinos seem to be following an increasingly homogeneous one-party orientation. In the last congressional election, nearly 70 percent of Latinos supported Democratic candidates. In California, they played a key role in the overturning of several Congressional seats, and reinforcing the one-party domination of the Legislature. What is the agenda? Latino voters, many of whom tend to be socially conservative, have been won over by Democrats based largely on immigration policy. “Almost any time that Donald Trump talks about immigration, he’s offending a large number of people in California,” notes pollster Mark Baldassare. Yet over time the Democrats’ “open borders” stance could prove surprisingly controversial even in the Latino community. After all, the newcomers, notably the undocumented, represent what Marx called “a reserve army of the unemployed.” Generally speaking, the influx of mostly poor migrants works largely against other low-wage workers while being something of bonus to the gentry classes, reducing the costs of gardening, housecleaning and, for some businesses, workers as well. Other parts of the Democratic agenda hurt more directly. Trump’s economic policies have been, at least to date, beneficial for lower-end workers and minorities but the Democrats’ increasingly draconian climate change agenda hurts the very industries — construction, manufacturing, logistics — that employ many members of the community. In California Latinos account for 20 percent more of the manufacturing workforce and warehouses than their share of the population, and almost twice as large a share in construction. In energy, mining and agriculture, their share is roughly five times larger than their proportion of the population. Cutting off water to the Central Valley to improve fish runs mean little to Silicon Valley or Hollywood but could prove devastating to farm workers. Identity or uplift? Democrats used to support policies that helped lift working people through economic opportunity, homeownership and entrepreneurship. Now they show little interest in any industries other than real estate, information and media, from where they draw their financial support. Many Latino legislators are complicit in this. Failed senatorial candidate Kevin de León and media darling Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have accepted the notion of “leftist” moneymen like Tom Steyer who are more focused on carbon emissions than the economic health of their struggling communities. Talk of the “Green New Deal,” with massive expenditures and necessitating large new taxes, is likely a fairy tale we can tell our children so they will go to bed. Latino political power, with such leadership, helps the well-connected few but not close to the majority. In California, where Latino influence in Sacramento has grown, the relative economic position of the community has declined. Latinos suffer rates of poverty in California well above the national average, with over half of households barely making ends meet. Alternatives better than vassalage Of course, as long as Trumpistas run the GOP, you cannot expect Latinos to embrace Republicans. But the community would do well focus more on economics and improvement of the dysfunctional education system than a “Green New Deal,” cultural or social issues. Support for extreme climate legislation and the teachers’ unions might fill the campaign coffers of the Latino political class but does not serve their constituents’ interests. One model for the future may be found in Texas metros Dallas, Houston, Austin and San Antonio, where the Latino population has grown this decade roughly five times the rate of Los Angeles or San Francisco. Texas’ vibrant manufacturing and construction growth has provided many opportunities for Latino families; these cities are all among the best for Latino entrepreneurs. More than 50 percent of Latinos in Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston own their own homes; in San Francisco and Los Angeles this percentage is 25 percent or more lower. This economics-first approach has been adopted by Latino politicians in both parties. “The consensus in San Antonio,” notes former Mayor and Clinton HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros, “is all about jobs. Everything is driven by that. The idea of inclusiveness for Latinos may have started a political dialogue but now everything is focused on business and opportunity. People get along because we have same goals.” Cisneros’ approach sets the standard for Latino politicians, and would be greatly welcome in California. Racial solidarity may be fine, but the long-term future of any community, if it wants to gain independence for its members, depends on economic prosperity. If Latinos wish to reach their potential, and help us all reach ours, this needs to be the primary focus. Joel Kotkin is the R.C.

{"global_context": "But her emails, the Fox News host lamented. Sean Hannity mourned the death of “equal justice under the law” on Tuesday, riled up that President Donald Trump’s former associates were deemed guilty of crimes when his Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton had not been. “Equal justice under the law ... is dead,” Hannity said during his opening monologue. The Fox News host was responding to reports that Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort was convicted of eight of 18 charges, including five counts of tax fraud, in the first trial of special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe. Manafort faces a maximum of 80 years in prison. The judge declared a mistrial after the jurors failed to reach a decision on the remaining 10 charges. Cohen, Trump’s former personal lawyer, entered into a plea deal with prosecutors on Tuesday, pleading guilty to eight charges including bank fraud, tax fraud and campaign finance violations due to his payments of “hush money” in 2016 to women who said they had affairs with Trump several years earlier. Cohen said he paid the women at the direction of Trump. “Cohen and Manafort ― literally prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law for bank and tax frauds, etc.,” Hannity said. “In today’s two-tiered justice system, as a Democrat, clearly you can commit financial fraud and get away with it. By the way, that’s just the tip of the iceberg.” The host then launched into an attack on Clinton and her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, saying she “destroyed classified information, which violates the espionage act.” “And then you can delete subpoenaed emails ... 33,000 of them and acid-wash your hard drive ... and eliminate the evidence, and have your aide smash up your devices with hammers, and get away with it,” he added. An FBI investigation into Clinton’s email use concluded in 2016 that there was no evidence that prosecution was warranted. Then-FBI Director James Comey said there was evidence of potential mishandling of classified information and referred the matter to the Justice Department, which closed the investigation without bringing charges. A State Department inspector general report concluded that Clinton had violated the government’s policy on email use but that such violations were not criminal. Hannity, who was also a client of Cohen’s, told viewers that he suspected prosecutors “forced” the attorney to say Trump knew about the hush money payments. He also told his viewers that there were lessons to learn from Tuesday’s news, including not lying to the FBI and paying taxes.

{"global_context": "The government said it had reunified more than 1,440 kids with their parents — but hundreds remain in shelters. Joe Raedle/Getty Images A man identified only as Emiliano spends time with his son, Hermy, 8, as they are cared for in an Annunciation House facility after they were reunited Wednesday after two months apart. KARNES CITY, Texas ― The Trump administration on Thursday applauded its own efforts to meet a midnight deadline to reunite more than 1,400 families it had separated at the border in previous months. But while the government insisted it would meet the court-ordered deadline, more than 700 children remained in government-contracted shelters without their families. And hundreds of parents were either deported or remain in legal limbo after immigration authorities pressured them to sign away their right to ask to stay in the United States. Trump administration officials said Thursday evening that they expected to reunite eligible families separated at the border by the end of the day, the deadline set by U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw. A month earlier, the San Diego-based judge ordered the government to reunite the more than 2,000 children it had taken from their parents. But when touting its claimed success, the administration counted only those families it deemed eligible for reunification ― excluding 700 kids whose parents were deported, released, failed a background check or were not yet located. The government had reunited about 1,440 children with their parents by Thursday afternoon and was on track to reunite all eligible parents that were in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody by the end of the day, according to a court filing and briefing with reporters. About 380 additional children were discharged from government custody through other circumstances, some to parents and others to sponsors. Of those families reunited, hundreds will likely be released into the U.S., where they can pursue their immigration claims in court. But for hundreds of others, the chaos caused by the Trump administration’s family separations was far from over ― even if they were now reunited. As many as 900 parents have final orders of removal, according to government statements in court. But their children, whose cases are separate, may not. That means parents will need to make a complicated decision: Fight for asylum together with their children, agree to leave the U.S. together or be separated again if the parent is deported and the child stays to seek safety. More than 230 family units are currently detained at family residential centers, a government official told reporters. At a family detention facility in Karnes City, Texas, on Thursday, dozens of parents who had just been reunited with their children told lawyers with the legal aid group RAICES that they wanted to be deported as soon as possible. Leaving the United States, they hoped, would finally bring an end to the trauma their families had endured. On Thursday alone, RAICES lawyers met with more than 100 parents ― the vast majority of them men ― who had been reunited with their children. Many of them fell to tears during their interviews, the lawyers told HuffPost. “Their children aren’t the same,” attorney María Osornio said. “A lot of them just want to get out of here as soon as possible.” One man intended to return to his home country while leaving his child behind, RAICES lawyers said. Virtually all of the families that RAICES lawyers and legal aides met with at the Karnes detention center on Thursday had already signed a form consenting to their own deportation, said Jennifer Falcon, the communications director for the legal aid group. Attorneys assisting the families are working to fight some of the deportations, but they said many of their clients’ cases were complicated and confusing. Some of the parents arrived with little paperwork. Lawyers have questioned the legality of the forms that many migrants signed consenting to their own deportations, arguing that their clients either didn’t understand what they were doing or did so under pressure. It’s unclear, however, whether the attorneys will be able to obtain hearings before an immigration judge to reverse the deportations before the government carries them out. “We’re just trying to do the best we can so they don’t get screwed,” lawyer Casey Miller said. The ACLU will argue in court on Friday that Judge Sabraw should require the government to halt deportations of separated families for a week after attorneys are notified of their reunification so lawyers have time to comb through the cases. Drew Anthony Smith via Getty Images Dozens of families have been reunited this week at the Karnes County Residential Center in South Texas. And the 1,400 families who were reunited in the past weeks are just some of the parents and children separated at the border. The government said 711 children remained in government custody away from their parents as of Thursday afternoon. A woman who crossed in May as part of the Central American “caravan” told HuffPost she was reunited with her 5-year-old child but that her husband was still in custody. The woman, Elena Martinez, said that he had been slated for release but that he called her from Port Isabel Detention Center in Texas on Thursday to tell her he remained locked up, along with two other Salvadoran nationals whose children remained in shelters. The parents of 431 detained children are no longer in the U.S., which a government official said was because they were deported. Sabraw said these parents will also need a chance at reunification under his order. The government said that 120 parents signed forms to waive reunification with their children, but attorneys believe some may have done so under duress or without understanding what the documents meant. The Trump administration has disputed this and argues parents have access to written statements notifying them of their rights and are given an explanation of the forms in a language they understand. The Trump administration said parents who are being deported are always given an opportunity to have their children go with them. Aid groups are also concerned about the 57 parents the government said were ineligible to be reunited with their child because of red flags in the parents’ background. Without more specifics, the advocates argued, it was difficult to know whether people were being wrongly disqualified. ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt said there’s considerable work ahead and admonished the government for what he said was a self-congratulatory tone about its hard work to reunite the families it split up.

{"global_context": "The deep state exists after all. But it turns out that deep state is not made up of the permanent bureaucracy, shadowy intelligence officials, or even Obama administration holdovers; rather it is made up of President Trump's own senior appointees. WASHINGTON -- The \"deep state\" exists after all. But it turns out that deep state is not made up of the permanent bureaucracy, shadowy intelligence officials, or even Obama administration holdovers; rather it is made up of President Trump's own senior appointees. In a New York Times op-ed, an unnamed \"senior official in the Trump administration\" admits that he and others \"in and around the White House\" are \"working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda\" and thwart \"Mr. Trump's more misguided impulses until he is out of office.\" The author declares that he and his co-conspirators are being \"unsung heroes\" fighting on the inside to \"preserve our democratic institutions.\" In fact, they are doing precisely the opposite. President Trump asked on Twitter whether the writer had committed \"TREASON?\" No, he (or she) has not. But the writer and the other members of this \"quiet resistance within the administration\" have betrayed the solemn oath they took when they raised their right hands and pledged to \"bear true faith and allegiance\" to the U.S. Constitution. The Constitution vests executive power in the president, not \"senior officials.\" Any authority these appointees have comes from the president, at whose pleasure they serve. For an unelected appointee to hide documents or refuse to carry out the lawful orders of the elected president is not noble. It is not patriotic. It is an assault on democracy. If you are a presidential appointee who strongly disagrees with something the president is about to do, you have a moral obligation to try to convince the president that he is wrong. If you can't do so, and the matter is sufficiently serious, then you have an obligation to resign -- and explain to the American people why you did so. But there is no constitutional option of staying on the job and pretending to be a loyal adviser, while secretly undermining the president by failing to carry out his decisions -- no matter how bad you think those decisions are. Yet, according to the author, that is precisely what he (or she) and many senior officials are doing. And the conduct the author describes matches named senior administration officials' actions described in Bob Woodward's new book, \"Fear.\" According to Woodward, then-economic adviser Gary Cohn \"stole a letter off Trump's desk\" to avoid formally withdrawing from a U.S-South Korea trade agreement -- and later bragged to a colleague that the president never even realized it was missing. Woodward further reports that Cohn did the same with a document to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, telling then-staff secretary Rob Porter \"I can stop this. I'll just take the paper off his desk.\" It would be a horrible decision to withdraw from those trade agreements. And it would be perfectly legitimate to campaign internally to dissuade the president from doing so. But for the head of the National Economic Council to conspire with the White House staff secretary to hide documents from the president is rank insubordination. No one elected the economic adviser or the staff secretary. They elected Donald Trump. It is important that good people serve in the administration and try their best to persuade the president to make good decisions and dissuade him from bad ones. But when you go from advising to subverting the president, you cross a moral and constitutional line. You are no longer defending democracy; you are subverting it. And to boast about your duplicitous behavior in the media is shameful. In our system of checks and balances, there are a number of options at the disposal of officials concerned about the president's fitness for office. If the president is as unstable as the writer suggests, and if many within the administration share that view, then a mass resignation would be appropriate. That could certainly make an impact on the midterm elections and flip control of the House and Senate to the Democrats, providing a check on the president's power. If Trump is truly incompetent, then members of the Cabinet can agree to notify Congress that they do not believe the president can carry out his duties under the 25th Amendment. If he has committed high crimes and misdemeanors, Congress can impeach him. But seeking to thwart the president from within by extra-constitutional means is un-American. There is no shame in not serving a president you don't respect. Many conservatives have made that decision. But if you feel you can't serve the president honorably, then there is only one honorable thing to do: Don't serve at all.

{"global_context": "After the two couples — President Donald Trump and his wife and federal judge Brett Kavanaugh and his wife — gathered in the residence of the White House for over an hour Sunday night, Trump made Kavanaugh a historic offer: to be his choice to succeed Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court. Yet just hours later on Monday morning, Trump seemed to waver — making a flurry of calls to friends and allies and asking them what they thought of Kavanaugh and whom he should nominate. Some White House advisers fretted Trump might reverse himself even after informing Vice President Mike Pence and White House Counsel Donald McGahn that he had reached a final decision. Others shrugged off his apparent waffling as the showman president attempting to inject a last bit of suspense into his second Supreme Court nomination. The 24-hour whirlwind leading up to Monday night's prime time announcement, and the 12-day stretch that preceded it, was classic Trump — a freewheeling process involving an eclectic cast of advisers and punctuated by bouts of indecision and drama. \"All a little misdirection,\" said a White House official, speaking anonymously to share a candid look at the search. \"How much did he enjoy the media tripping all over themselves? I'm sure he loved it.\" Ultimately, in Kavanaugh, Trump chose not just an unabashed conservative candidate likely to please his base but one who appealed to him for other reasons, as well: personal chemistry, Ivy League credentials and a compelling personal story. Raj Shah, a White House spokesman, likened the nomination strategy to a marketing campaign, saying it had the benefit of pitching a premium product. \"We have a well-qualified, articulate nominee whose record will sell itself,\" Shah said. This portrait of Trump's Supreme Court nomination decision is the result of interviews with more than two dozen White House aides, members of Congress, Republican operatives, outside advisers, presidential friends and confidants, many of whom requested anonymity to share details of private conversations. Trump \"landed where he started\" said a senior White House official, explaining that the president settled on the federal judge who had been his favored candidate since learning of Kennedy's retirement. Kavanaugh was also the top choice of McGahn, who sat in on nearly every interview and meeting. Kavanaugh's years in the White House of George W. Bush, who then nominated him to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, were a knock against the judge in the eyes of Trump, who frequently rails against the Bush dynasty. But those concerns began to dissipate during their initial in-person interview on July 2, when the 72-year-old president and the 53-year-old judge established a rapport. Kavanaugh advocates also worked to convince Trump that merely by offering him a lifetime appointment to the nation's top court, the justice would inherently become a \"Trump guy\" rather than a \"Bush guy.\" \"Bush put him on the D.C. Circuit; Trump put him on the Supreme Court,\" a senior White House adviser said. \"That's not a lateral move.\" Both McGahn and Kavanaugh also sought to portray the judge's lengthy record — including more than 300 opinions, roughly a dozen of which were affirmed by the Supreme Court — as a benefit rather than a potential stumbling block. While it might complicate his confirmation process, they told Trump, Kavanaugh would be the safest and most appealing candidate for the president's conservative base. After that first sit-down, Kavanaugh emerged as the clear front-runner. One person familiar with the interview said Kavanaugh, who worked closely with Bush as his staff secretary, \"knew exactly how to talk to Trump\" because he understands how presidents operate. \"Brett has been planning for this his whole life,\" the person said. Trump, a proud graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, was also impressed with Kavanaugh's dual undergraduate and law degrees from Yale. The president has long viewed an Ivy League pedigree as a mark of intelligence and is, in the words of a senior White House official, an unabashed \"credentialist.\" In the end, one of Kavanaugh's biggest hurdles was that he was the \"conventional wisdom\" pick, while Trump relishes defying the experts. For his part, Trump mostly hewed to the process laid out by activists, basing his search off a list of roughly two dozen judges and legal figures who were preapproved by conservative groups, said Leonard Leo, an executive at the Federalist Society. \"What people need to remember, is the president came up with the idea of doing the list and wanted to make the Supreme Court a very big issue in the presidential campaign,\" Leo said. \"He took ownership of the list, and it helped propel him to victory and hold the Senate, so it's no surprise he wants to be in the driver's seat on judicial selection and keep up what's worked.\" On the same day as the Kavanaugh interview, Trump also met in person with three of the four other finalists — Amy Coney Barrett, Raymond Kethledge and Amul Thapar. (The only finalist he did not meet with in person was Thomas Hardiman, who was the runner-up for the vacancy filled last year by Justice Neil Gorsuch, though the two men spoke twice by phone).

{"global_context": "The U.S. House of Representatives voted on Tuesday to condemn President Donald Trump for \"racist comments\" against four minority Democratic congresswomen, a symbolic measure aimed at shaming Trump and his fellow Republicans who stood by him. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives voted on Tuesday to condemn President Donald Trump for “racist comments” against four minority Democratic congresswomen, a symbolic measure aimed at shaming Trump and his fellow Republicans who stood by him. The 240-187 vote, which split mainly along party lines, was the culmination of three days of outrage sparked by a Trump tweetstorm that diverted attention from other business in Washington but had little impact on the president’s overall approval rating, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll. Trump is seeking re-election next year. Trump had told the group of congresswomen on Sunday to “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.” All four lawmakers - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan - are U.S. citizens. Three were born in the United States. Democrats, who have a majority in the House, passed the resolution on Tuesday evening, which said the House “strongly condemns President Donald Trump’s racist comments that have legitimized and increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color.” Four Republicans and one independent joined the Democrats to support the measure. The White House did not immediately comment. Trump’s attacks on the four progressive congresswomen - known as “the squad” - have been viewed as an effort to divide Democrats, who won control of the House in 2018 and have the power to thwart his legislative agenda. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has struggled at times to work with the progressive newcomers in her caucus, staunchly defended them in the debate. After the vote, Omar held a long, animated conversation with Pelosi on the House floor and put her arm around the speaker, the top elected U.S. Democrat. “These comments from the White House are disgraceful and disgusting and these comments are racist,” Pelosi said. “Every single member of this institution, Democratic and Republican, should join us in condemning the president’s racist tweets.” Pelosi’s comments put the House into a two-hour limbo after Republicans argued she went too far in her comments and broke debate rules. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy criticized Democrats for remarks that upset the “order and decency” of the chamber, saying: “Today is the day that historians will write about.” Some Republicans defended Trump’s tweets, like Tom McClintock of California, who said the president was commenting on the patriotism of the congresswomen, not their race. “I wish the president were more temperate in the words he sometimes uses and I agree that the tone of his recent remarks was unnecessarily provocative.

REUTERS/Erin Scott Republican Representative Doug Collins of Georgia said lawmakers should be pursuing reconciliation rather than escalating attacks against Trump, condemning the “breathtaking partisanship of today’s exercise.” Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters that he thought “everybody ought to tone down their rhetoric.” “The president is not a racist and I think the tone of all of this is not good for the country, but it’s coming from all different ideological points of view,” McConnell said. REUTERS/IPSOS POLL: LITTLE POLITICAL DAMAGE Trump has a history of what critics consider race-baiting. He led a movement that falsely claimed Barack Obama - America’s first black president - was not born in the United States, and said after a deadly, white supremacist-led rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 that there were “very fine people on both sides” of the incident. Trump’s approval rating plunged after the 2017 comments. But a Reuters/Ipsos poll this week showed little immediate political damage from his latest tweetstorm. Support among Republicans increased slightly, the poll showed, while he lost support with Democrats and independents after the comments. His overall approval rating was unchanged. At his rallies, Trump has often talked about proposals from the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, which he calls extreme, as he seeks to energize his political base ahead of the November 2020 presidential election.

{"global_context": "Republicans have accused Peter Strzok, who previously worked on special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, of being anti-Trump. WASHINGTON ― FBI agent Peter Strzok helped draft a letter that, in the final days of the 2016 presidential campaign, signaled the re-opening of a probe into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s emails, CNN reported Wednesday. Strzok is one of the FBI agents whom some Republicans have accused of scheming to undermine President Donald Trump ahead of the 2016 election. He worked on both the Clinton probe as well as the Russia probe when it was in its early stages, and later joined special counsel Robert Mueller’s team. The letter Strzok helped draft, sent to Congress by then-FBI Director James Comey on Oct. 28 ― days ahead of the 2016 election ― dealt a blow to Clinton, whom Trump repeatedly attacked for using a personal email while serving as secretary of state. Comey penned another letter just before the election saying no new relevant information was found, and stood by the FBI’s prior decision not to recommend charges The FBI’s actions ahead of the 2016 campaign hurt Clinton, while the bureau stayed quiet about its ongoing probe into ties between Trump associates and Russia. Nevertheless, many Republicans have been working off of the idea that the FBI’s actions somehow hurt Trump’s election, and say the FBI continued to work behind the scenes to undermine his presidency. Republicans have seized upon text messages between Strzok and an FBI attorney with whom he had a relationship, Lisa Page. Neither were fans of Trump, but they also exchanged texts venting about Democratic politicians and figures as well. One particular text ― a joke about a “secret society” sent hours after Trump’s election ― drew lots of attention from Republicans, who painted it as evidence of a vast conspiracy within the bureau. As it turned out, the joke was made in connection with gag gift calendars Strzok had bought for the team working on the Russia probe that featured “beefcake” photos of Russian President Vladimir Putin. CNN reported that Strzok did have reservations about Comey making the announcement public, and text messages showed they were troubled by the fallout from the letter. “Christ. It’s there led on freaking MARKETPLACE,” Page texted, an apparent reference to the NPR show. “Our statement affected the stock market. 😡” FBI texts Republican theories about the actions of the two FBI employees haven’t really panned out, as HuffPost has reported. Republicans suggested that they were leaking anti-Trump information to the media, when in reality, Page cooperated with a story in which she defended the bureau’s handling of the Clinton probe. Another set of texts indicated they rejected an outsider’s suggestion that the FBI should have gone after agents leaking information about the Clinton investigation by monitoring an ex-FBI official’s phone.

Ten people died when gunmen tried to storm a church south of Cairo, but were intercepted by police. About an hour later, a Coptic-owned shop in the same area was attacked, leaving two dead. More than 100 Christians have been killed in Egypt in the past year - most attacks claimed by the local branch of the so-called Islamic State group. Security forces have put checkpoints in place around the capital in response to the attacks. They announced plans earlier this week to protect festivities around the New Year and, on 7 January, Coptic Christmas. They include the deployment of rapid-reaction forces and jamming equipment. Friday's first attack appears to have taken place when police patrolling the Mar Mina church noticed two men behaving suspiciously, reports the BBC's Radwa Gamal in Cairo. They approached the men, who began firing. At least three police officers were among the 10 dead, but it was not clear how many civilians died or whether the toll included the dead attacker. There are reports that several people were wounded, two critically.

It was safely defused. The other gunman escaped but was reportedly later arrested with weapons, ammunition and a bomb. Following this attack reports came in of another shooting in the same area. In a statement on its Facebook page, the Egyptian Coptic Orthodox Church said the two dead were owners of the household appliances shop that was targeted. Egypt's Copts have in the past accused authorities of only token gestures to protect them and these incidents will not help calm tensions, our correspondent says.

Last April at least 45 people died in twin attacks on Coptic churches in Alexandria and the Nile Delta city of Tanta. At least 29 Copts were killed on a bus en route to a monastery in central Egypt in May and a Coptic Orthodox priest was stabbed to death in Cairo in October.

{"global_context": "The 16-year Capitol Hill veteran was chairman of the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. Former congressman Jeff Miller, who chaired the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs before retiring from Congress last year, is considered a leading candidate to become President Trump’s next nominee for VA secretary, according to several people familiar with the matter. The Florida Republican, who spent 16 years in Congress and now works in Washington as a lobbyist, is scheduled to meet Wednesday with officials in a White House vetting office and possibly Trump, according to the people, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the personnel issue. A senior administration official who confirmed Trump’s interest in Miller said a decision is not expected before next week. Reached by phone Wednesday, Miller said he had “no comment” when asked whether he had been asked about joining the administration or would want the job leading the second-largest Cabinet department. Several other candidates are still believed to be under consideration, including Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.), who Trump has said would make a great governor of Florida. After White House physician Ronny L. Jackson withdrew from consideration last week amid allegations of professional misconduct, Trump said that there was great interest in the VA position from others and that the candidates included “some very political people.” Trump suggested that a nominee with more political experience would have been better positioned to handle the kind of allegations Jackson faced. [Ronny Jackson withdraws as Trump’s nominee to lead Veterans Affairs] Jackson, a rear admiral in the Navy, dropped out amid unverified allegations of drinking on the job and creating a hostile work environment — allegations he vigorously denied. Trump has also called the allegations false, saying Jackson was the victim of slander. Miller is one of two candidates that House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) publicly suggested to Trump last week. Ryan also floated the possibility of Rep. Phil Roe (R-Tenn.), the current chairman of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee. Miller has been fiercely critical of VA’s long wait times for veterans and has been an outspoken critic of its services, often highlighting dysfunctional hospital staffs, the silencing of whistleblowers and inspector-general reports on topics including dirty hospitals and botched surgeries. While a member of the committee, he pushed to expand the Veterans Choice Program, which allows veterans to seek medical care at taxpayer expense from providers outside VA’s network. Trump also favors expanding the program, which was a point of contention with the last VA secretary, David Shulkin, whom Trump fired in late March. [How a Koch-backed veterans group gained influence in Trump’s Washington] That action followed an inspector general’s report that said Shulkin took his wife on a business trip at taxpayers’ expense. There were also tensions with conservatives over the extent to which Shulkin was willing to outsource care. A top VA official said he hopes that the administration will “take its time in choosing the next candidate,” asking not to be named, because he was not authorized to speak about the issue. “For the sake of the vets,” the official said, “we all need to get this right.” From the start, Jackson was a startling pick, according to lawmakers and veterans groups who were concerned that he did not have the experience to manage a department with 360,000 employees serving 9 million veterans. One person close to the White House and familiar with the selection process said that Miller has “never clicked” with Trump. Miller was not interviewed for the VA job before Trump took office, despite the fact that he and Trump spent a lot of time together during the transition, the person said. This person described any meeting between Trump and Miller a “pulse check,” adding, “Trump is Trump, and he’s going to do what he wants to do.” Miller, however, has the respect of key people in the president’s orbit because of his work with Trump on veterans issues during campaign, the person said. After Jackson’s exit, some veterans groups were strongly backing VA Deputy Secretary Thomas G. Bowman, who was appointed by Trump and confirmed by the Senate in August. As recently as last month, however, Bowman’s job was said to be in jeopardy. He has been at odds with the administration over its plan to expand health-care access for veterans through private providers. Bowman served for 30 years in the Marine Corps and spent a decade at VA before becoming the majority staff director for the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee. He has also worked as a private lawyer concentrating on military and veterans issues. Another name floated by veterans groups is the agency’s acting head, Robert Wilkie, who told employees recently that he wants to refocus an organization beset by internal division. During a public event at the White House last week, Trump said Wilkie “is doing a great job over at the VA.” Wilkie has been walking the halls of VA’s Washington headquarters, holding meetings with small groups of employees and inquiring about their duties, said a senior VA official who was not authorized to speak with the media and commented on the condition of anonymity. In a three-minute video distributed to employees, Wilkie, 55, emphasized the agency’s sacred mission of caring for those who have fought the nation’s wars. Bob Wallace, executive director of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, called VA “a national treasure” and said whoever is selected to lead the department must be a proven and effective leader with management experience. Dan Caldwell, a spokesman for Concerned Veterans for America, a conservative group, said its membership thinks highly of Miller. “He did very fine work as chairman,” said Caldwell, whose group has been pushing for veterans to be able to receive private care at taxpayer expense. “We know his approach to the issue would be thoughtful, and he didn’t rush into it before when the program started.” Josh Dawsey contributed to this report.

{"global_context": "President Donald Trump's UK state dinner will be held at Blenheim Palace, a historic property in Oxfordshire. Written by Jonathan Glancey, CNN Jonathan Glancey is a British architecture critic and author. When President Donald Trump and the first lady arrive for a black-tie dinner in the UK this evening, the guards will march, the bands will play and the Royal Regiment of Scotland will pipe the couple away at the end of the evening as they retire to the US ambassador's residence in Regent's Park in London. Prime Minister Theresa May will host the reception, while a host of British business leaders from a range of sectors will hang on to the President's every word between starter and pudding. One person missing at the palace dinner, though, will be the Queen. Why? Because the Trump dinner is not being held at Buckingham or any other royal palace. It will be at Blenheim Palace, the only palace in Britain not owned by the monarchy or the church. A visiting head of state ought to have dinner in a palace and, given the controversy and security issues surrounding Trump's visit, Blenheim fits the bill. Sited near both Chequers, the Prime Minister's country house where the President will join May for talks on Friday morning, and Windsor Castle, where the Trumps will take tea with the Queen in the afternoon, Blenheim Palace is also reassuringly isolated in an estate stretching across more than 2,000 acres of Oxfordshire countryside. Blenheim Palace, built for John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, in the 18th century, sits on more than 2,000 acres in Oxfordshire. Credit: English Heritage/Getty Images Blenheim Palace, though, is a significant choice for the Trump dinner for reasons the President is sure to appreciate. It is the birthplace of Winston Churchill, one of Trump's heroes, whose bust is on display in the Oval Office. To many Americans, Churchill has always been more than the unpredictable and bullish premier who defeated Hitler and cemented the special relationship between Britain and the US: he's virtually an honorary American himself. Although Churchill's father was Lord Randolph, third son of the 7th Duke of Marlborough, but his mother, Jennie Churchill, was the Brooklyn-born daughter of Leonard Jerome, a New York financier and speculator. What's more, when the magnificent English baroque palace -- built as a national monument and grandiloquent home for esteemed general and statesman John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough -- fell into disrepair in the late 19th century, it was an American who came to the rescue: Consuelo Vanderbilt, an heir to the formidable Vanderbilt railroad fortune, and one of the richest women in America. The 9th Duke of Marlborough needed money, while Consuelo's domineering mother, Alva, wanted her daughter to wed into old-world aristocracy. There was no love between the couple but, eventually, a deal was struck. In 1895, Consuelo and the duke were married, and he was paid $2.5 million -- some $70 million in today's money -- for the pleasure. This torrent of American cash paid for essential repairs as well as improvements to Blenheim Palace.

Credit: Education Images/UIG via Getty Images Roller-coaster finances, high-profile marriages of convenience, and American connections aside, Trump might also be interested in the fact that the commission to design Blenheim Palace was given to dashing playwright, John Vanbrugh who, self-taught, was very much new to the design of buildings great or small when approached by the Duke of Marlborough, a fellow member of London's fashionable Kit-Kat Club. If alive today, the swashbuckling Vanbrugh, author of the successful and scandalous play \"The Provoked Wife\" (\"What cloying meat is love -- when matrimony's the sauce to it!\") might well be a popular television celebrity. And yet, although an architectural outsider, Vanbrugh, with the help of Nicholas Hawksmoor, made a brilliant job of Blenheim, despite destructive rows over spiraling costs and his being goaded into resigning in 1716, six years before the house -- far bigger, more imposing and architecturally important than Buckingham Palace has ever been -- was more or less completed.

Credit: DeAgostini/Getty Images Perhaps, too, President Trump, will like the fact that the first duke repeatedly thwarted the ambitions of Louis XIV and other continental monarchs keen on dominating Europe, while checking the ambitions of an independent and increasingly strong Britain. The imperiously grand baroque saloon in which the Trumps will dine was the social core of a house designed to outgun the Sun King's palace at Versailles. And indeed, it does seem a delicious choice of venue for a meal accompanied by deal-making and a side of history.

WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump on Sunday lashed out against what he called a “phony” investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russia last year, criticizing Democrats for conducting a “witch hunt” and saying that they ― including Hillary Clinton ― are the guilty ones. “There is so much GUILT by Democrats/Clinton, and now the facts are pouring out,” he tweeted. Trump’s Sunday morning rant on Twitter came amid reports that special counsel Robert Mueller, leading an independent investigation into the possible collusion and obstruction of justice, has filed the first criminal charges in the case. The indictment could be unsealed as soon as Monday, according to the reports.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2017 Insisting that collusion between his campaign and Russians “doesn’t exist,” Trump on Sunday proclaimed that Republicans “are now fighting back like never before.” He said that instead of investigating his campaign, more scrutiny is needed of Clinton and the Democratic National Committee for reportedly helping fund research contained in a Trump dossier that has come up in the investigations. Conservatives have eagerly used the news about the dossier ― which contains several unverified allegations against Trump and claims that Russia holds compromising material against him and his associates ― to discredit Mueller and his team. Trump has regularly said that Mueller’s probe, as well as the multiple congressional panels looking into the collusion issue, are a “witch hunt.” Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), vice chair of the House Intelligence Committee, said on Sunday that the target of the indictment stemming from Mueller’s investigation is “likely” former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort or former national security adviser Mike Flynn, who have both faced scrutiny for ties to Russia. Appearing on ABC’s “This Week,” he said members of the the House intelligence panel ― who are conducting their own investigation into ties between Trump’s campaign and Russia ― “haven’t been informed of who it is, and I don’t think it would been appropriate for Bob Mueller to tell us.” Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) said on CNN on Sunday that “whatever it is, it’s really just the beginning.” King is on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is also conducting a probe into the possible collusion. Later Sunday, Trump again criticized the “‘Russia’ talk,” claiming it was an effort to shift attention away from the Republican push to pass tax cuts.

Image copyright EPA North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui, seen here during the Hanoi summit North Korean leader Kim Jong-un may break off denuclearisation talks with the US and resume missile and nuclear testing, a senior official says. Vice Foreign Minister Choe Sun-hui told foreign diplomats the US threw away \"a golden opportunity\" at a recent summit between President Trump and Mr Kim. The meeting collapsed after Mr Trump refused to lift sanctions unless North Korea destroyed all its nuclear sites. North Korea had offered to dismantle its main Yongbyon nuclear complex. Mr Kim is set to make an official announcement on his position regarding future talks with the US soon, Ms Choe said in Pyongyang. \"We have no intention to yield to the US demands in any form, nor are we willing to engage in negotiations of this kind,\" Ms Choe said according to Russia's Tass news agency. \"Personal relations between the two supreme leaders are still good and the chemistry is mysteriously wonderful,\" the senior official added. Ms Choe pointed out that North Korea's demand during the recent summit was for five key economic sanctions to be lifted, not all sanctions as Mr Trump claimed after talks broke down. \"What is clear is that the US has thrown away a golden opportunity this time,\" she said. \"I'm not sure why the US came out with this different description. We never asked for the removal of sanctions in their entirety.\" The two leaders first met in Singapore last year, in an unprecedented summit between a US sitting president and a North Korean leader. Their second meeting was in Hanoi in February. At a news conference after the Hanoi summit, Mr Trump said no plans had been made for a third summit, but he expressed optimism about a \"good outcome\" in the future. Door to diplomacy still open Laure Bicker, BBC Seoul correspondent So does this mean a return to \"fire and fury\"? Not quite. North Korea's tactic might be to hope this will initiate a reaction from the US. Pyongyang is aware that Donald Trump has boasted about his ability to get Mr Kim to stop firing missiles and testing nuclear missiles. \"As long as there's no testing,\" said Mr Trump, \"I'm in no rush.\" After the two leaders failed to secure a deal in Hanoi, and with economic sanctions still in place, North Korea might be trying to hurry the US president along and get him back to the table with a better deal. It is worth noting Choe Sun-hui still praised the personal relationship between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump. So the door to diplomacy is still open. Instead she blamed the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton for hardening the US position. North Korea also has hardliners of its own, who may perceive Kim Jong-un's 120-hour train trip to Hanoi and back as a failure. This announcement lets them know, along with the Trump administration, that Mr Kim is standing firm.

Veuer's Sam Berman has the full story. Buzz60 An aide of former Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone was ordered Thursday to testify before special counsel Robert Mueller's grand jury, losing a bid for a judge to dismiss the investigation as unconstitutional. Andrew Miller's bid to block subpoenas for records and a grand jury testimony centered on the belief Mueller's appointment was \"unconstitutional.\" That quest was shot down in a 93-page ruling Thursday by U.S.District Chief Judge Beryl Howell. Miller briefly served as an assistant to Stone during the 2016 presidential campaign, reportedly handling media interviews. He and his attorney, Paul Kamenar, argued Mueller \"wields too much power with too little accountability\", which is detailed in the ruling. Miller was not named in the ruling but Kamenar told USA TODAY it was his client, explaining they may appeal the decision. \"We’re of course disappointed in the ruling,\" Kamenar said, adding they were encouraged that the court \"took it seriously\" as evidenced by the lengthy ruling. Kamenar would not answer questions about documents subpoenaed or whether there had been any negotiations with Mueller's team on an interview and potential questions.

The president has a history of calling prominent African-Americans 'low IQ.' It caters to white supremacist rhetoric. LeBron James speaks at a news conference after the opening ceremony for the I Promise School in Akron, Ohio, on July 30, 2018. (Photo: Phil Long/AP) President Donald Trump questioned the intelligence of basketball icon LeBron James and CNN's Don Lemon after James stated that Trump was using athletes to promote division in the country. Trump's words have prompted some to call him a bully; others have accused him of pandering to a racist base. First lady Melania Trump came out in support of James' charitable efforts. Trump picked wrong guy to fight with in James We have come to this: A president with a fourth-grade vocabulary and an aversion to truth, devoid of compassion and impulse control, is attacking the intelligence of a basketball star who just donated $50 million to build a school for at-risk students. That the most powerful man on the planet is also among the most peevish is, by now, a given. That Donald Trump would rather do battle with black athletes than malevolent dictators is, at a minimum, reflective of his skewed sensibilities and his willingness to pander to the racist element in his base. “Lebron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon,” Trump tweeted Friday night. “He made Lebron look smart, which isn’t easy to do. I like Mike!” First of all, it’s LeBron, not “Lebron.” Second, didn’t Trump call Bill Maher “the dumbest man on television” on Jan. 14, 2013? Are we to believe Maher got smarter in the interim or Lemon dumber? Third, shouldn’t the president of the United States have higher priorities than immediate payback for perceived slights? “A sign of an insecure human being is one who attacks others to make themselves feel better,” read a tweet from former Louisville star Donovan Mitchell's account on Saturday. “(I’m) just sad that young kids have to see stupid tweets like these and grow up thinking it’s okay ... forget everything else Donald your (sic) setting a bad example for kids.” Moreover, in responding to recurring jabs from James with a gratuitous, unsubstantiated shot at his brainpower, Trump has picked an unusually unpromising fight. James has spent his entire adult life as a celebrity and without the slightest scent of scandal or impropriety. He has stayed married to his high school sweetheart while Trump is on his third marriage and boasted about grabbing women by the genitals. Like Trump, James has earned a billion dollars, but without six corporate bankruptcies. In donating $50 million for the Akron “I Promise” school that opened Monday, James is providing an on-site food bank for students and job placement assistance for their parents. Each student is issued a bicycle and every graduate, beginning in 2021, is guaranteed free tuition at the University of Akron.

For the full column, visit www.courier-journal.com/staff/5355/tim-sullivan. What our readers are saying Letters edited for length and clarity: Bullying behavior usually comes from people who are insecure. They use brawn and ugly words to prove themselves. Today, right at this very moment, that mentality is coming from our White House. President Donald Trump is the bully of all bullies. This is certainly not fake news. His racist remarks at a rally in Ohio have proved that he is getting more emboldened and is frightened for the days when this house of cards will fall around him and possibly his family. His chosen punching bags, most recently, are celebrated sports icon LeBron James and TV news commentator Don Lemon. Both are African-Americans. To rally his base, Trump says negative things about their intelligence, as so many racists believe misguided rhetoric about men and women of color. Trump stokes coals by spurting out demeaning non-truths. He feels those words make him look strong. I believe Trump has proved that he, through his very own actions and words, is not a leader but a classic, insecure bully to the highest degree. Linda Gefen; Boca Raton, Fla. LeBron James really has chutzpah saying that the president is dividing the country by criticizing NFL players. No one in any profession has the right to protest at his workplace. It’s that simple. Not only that, the form of protest these NFL players are using is disrespecting the American flag. Plus, they do this using a platform that has tens of thousands of attendees and is shown to millions of Americans on television. And James thinks the president is dividing the country? That really takes guts. Tom Fryman; Delaware, Ohio Facebook comments edited for clarity: There is ongoing hate toward President Donald Trump. Melania Trump has done what any first lady should do in her job, create peace by reaching out. —Michael Younger I'm giving Melania Trump credit for this one. Her statement is a slap back at her husband, and sends a message to her son that here's a man who uses his fortune to do good. —Clint Murray If you ever say anything unflattering about Trump, rest assured he will throw you under the bus in a second. He lives for these moments. Goodness knows he isn't doing much of anything else. Expect it to come up at his next \"it's all about me\" pep rally that LeBron James is only a mediocre basketball player with no class. Hmmmm ... maybe they should check the origin of James' birth just in case a conspiracy needs to get generated for deportation. —Warren Weick A lot of people used to be LeBron fans, myself included. But how overbearing he has become. Good thing he is huge and gets all the calls his way in the league. —William E Mansfield What others are saying Karen Tumulty, The Washington Post: \"One of the most intriguing things about Melania Trump is the pointed yet cryptic way she seems to have found to drag her husband. ... Our oracular first lady was at it again on Saturday, seeming to issue a deft smackdown to a childish tweet President Trump had fired off late the night before. ... Melania Trump ... added the coup de grace, with a statement issued by her spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham: 'It looks like LeBron James is working to do good things on behalf of our next generation and just as she always has, the First Lady encourages everyone to have an open dialogue about issues facing children today. As you know, Mrs. Trump has traveled the country and world talking to children about their well-being, healthy living, and the importance of responsible online behavior with her Be Best initiative. Her platform centers around visiting organizations, hospitals and schools, and she would be open to visiting the I Promise School in Akron.' ... What’s significant is not just what a first lady says but when she decides to speak up. There is no requirement that she say anything at all, and this particular presidential spouse has been the most reticent going at least as far back as Pat Nixon.\" Jeff Zillgitt, USA TODAY: \"Since the 2016 election, Trump has had several opportunities to fire back at LeBron James for something James said about him. But until Friday evening, Trump resisted. Even when James called Trump a 'bum' and even when James said Trump doesn’t understand or care about the people, Trump said nothing. All the while, Trump bashed the NFL, some of its players and the Golden State Warriors, calling Steph Curry out by name. Trump left James alone — until Friday evening when he insulted the intelligence of James and CNN’s Don Lemon in a tweet. ... Why now? Joe Vardon, who covered James for Cleveland.com and covered Ohio politics before switching to sports, posits that Trump waited until James was no longer a full-time resident of Ohio, a swing state Trump needs to win in 2020. Now that James is moving to California — a state Trump won’t win — Trump felt it was OK to bash James in a tweet at 11:37 p.m. ET on a Friday. How that impacts the 2020 election, the people of Ohio will settle that. It seems like superficial play, if that’s why Trump attacked James with a third-grade insult that's hardly clever or mature.\" Dean Obeidallah, CNN: \"There's no disputing that Trump's pattern of attacking well-known African-Americans as having 'low IQs' or being of low intelligence is parroting the white nationalist view that blacks are inherently less intelligent than whites. The only question is whether Trump was intentionally espousing the views of white supremacists. Well, given Trump's history, there's only one reasonable conclusion: Trump knows exactly what he's saying.\" To join the conversations about topics on USA TODAY, email letters@usatoday.com, comment on Facebook, or use #tellusatoday on Twitter.

{"global_context": "In 'The Restless Wave,' John McCain reflects on not picking Joe Lieberman for vice president, the White House meeting on the 2008 financial crisis and being a Reagan Republican. CLOSE In an audio recording, of Sen. John McCain reads an excerpt from his book 'The Restless Wave.' In the excerpt, McCain reflects on human nature and conjures somewhat of a farewell message to the American people. (May 4) AP Sen. John McCain has a new memoir coming out in which he is expected to offer \"no-holds-barred opinions on the current developments\" in Washington. (Photo: Getty Images) PHOENIX — U.S. Sen. John McCain provides new insights into his 2008 White House campaign against Barack Obama and tries to put the President Donald Trump era into focus in a new memoir set for release Tuesday. The Restless Wave: Good Times, Just Causes, Great Fights, and Other Appreciations is the third book in an autobiographical trilogy that includes 1999's Faith of My Fathers and 2002's Worth the Fighting For. McCain again reunites with his former Senate chief of staff and longtime co-author Mark Salter for the book, in which the six-term Arizona Republican senator also reflects on the Iraq War, the need for comprehensive immigration reform, and Trump's character. Here are five more takeaways from The Restless Wave. May 14: Meghan McCain says Sadler should have expected her 'he's dying anyway' remark to be leaked May 13: John McCain: Sen. Lindsey Graham says White House should apologize for aide's 'disgusting' remark McCain suggests his confused questioning of Comey was related to his brain tumor McCain seems to believe that his garbled questioning of former FBI director James Comey during a June 8, 2017, hearing is related to his life-threatening glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. McCain writes that he felt \"something was off\" after he returned from a multination overseas congressional-delegation trip. \"I didn't know exactly what,\" McCain writes. \"Fatigue mostly.\" May 12: In new book, John McCain says 'anyone can become an American if they embrace our values' May 12: Who is defending John McCain after White House aide's 'dying anyway' remark — who isn't? During the notorious Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, McCain at one point made a reference to \"President Comey.\" At the time, McCain had said he stayed up the night before watching an Arizona Diamondbacks game. Later, he told Esquire that his friend, U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., had emailed him a question to ask. However, the question dropped off the smartphone, and he tried to wing it by memory with disastrous results. \"Something happened between reading the question and asking it,\" McCain writes in his memoir. \"To this day, I'm really not sure what caused it. But as was widely noted at the time, I was incomprehensible. It was a high-profile hearing, carried live by the cable news networks. My strange performance was the focus of commentary on cable and fuel for Twitter. I felt embarrassed for myself and sorry for confusing Comey. It was one of the more mortifying experiences of my public career. Even now, I wince at the memory of it.\" May 11: Meghan McCain wonders how White House staffer who mocked her dad can 'still have a job' May 11: Donald Trump aide who said John McCain is 'dying anyway' still has a job It may be difficult to know definitively whether McCain's confused questioning of Comey was directly related to his brain cancer, but McCain writes as though he thinks it did. First, he tried to \"put the whole thing down to a bad bout of jet lag,\" McCain writes, but \"a small concern nagged at me\" ahead of his July 14 regular physical at Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Ariz. That medical visit revealed a need for immediate cranial surgery, which led to his brain-cancer diagnosis. Anyone who doesn't like his handling of Trump dossier 'can go to hell' McCain also gives his most complete version of his role in intrigue surrounding a dossier of salacious research and raw intelligence on Trump and his connections with the Russians. McCain previously acknowledged getting a copy of the dossier, which was authored by Christopher Steele, a former British MI6 officer, and giving it to the FBI, which already was aware of the material. May 11: John McCain won't be buried with his father, grandfather at Arlington National Cemetery May 11: Sarah Palin: McCain admitting he'd rather have had Lieberman as running mate was 'gut punch' \"I had an obligation to bring to the attention of appropriate officials unproven accusations I could not assess myself, and which, were any of them true, would create a vulnerability to the designs of a hostile foreign power,\" McCain writes in the book. \"I discharged that obligation, and I would do it again. Anyone who doesn't like it can go to hell.\" Everyone! @SenJohnMcCain confirmed this way back in January 2017! This isn’t some new revelation! Except for the go to hell part. That’s new ☺️ https://t.co/ko5KeBnhFthttps://t.co/6cM4dhwrdH — Julie Tarallo (@julietarallo) May 10, 2018 McCain confirms that he learned about the so-called Steele dossier from Sir Andrew Wood, a former British ambassador to Russia, while attending the November 2016 Halifax International Security Forum in Nova Scotia. McCain also speculates on why Wood and Steele sought him out. \"That's the first accusatory question in every budding conspiracy theory about my minor role in the controversy,\" McCain writes. \"The answer is too obvious for the paranoid to credit. I am known internationally to be a persistent critic of Vladimir Putin's regime, and I have been for a long while. Wood and Steele likely assumed that my animosity toward Putin, which I unapologetically acknowledge, ensured that I would take their concerns seriously. They assumed correctly.\" CLOSE Eight years after an unsuccessful long-shot presidential bid, John McCain took another run at the nation’s highest office. He would run against a young senator from Illinois named Barack Obama. In the end, McCain again would not be president. McCain regrets not tapping Joe Lieberman, but defends Sarah Palin It's not news that McCain wanted to choose his friend Joe Lieberman, the Democrat-turned-independent senator from Connecticut, as his 2008 running mate. However, The Restless Wave gives McCain's inside account of how he wound up tapping then-unknown Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin instead. Picking Lieberman would have been perhaps McCain's most maverick move ever. But it also would have carried a huge risk of alienating the GOP's conservative base — which already was less than thrilled that McCain was that year's nominee — and possibly cause a revolt at the Republican National Convention in St. Paul. May 11: Decency in Trump administration hit rock bottom with McCain dying 'joke,' Biden says May 10: 'He's dying anyway': White House official mocked Sen. John McCain, reports say McCain and Lieberman were allies on national security but parted ways on other key issues, including abortion rights. McCain's advisers talked him out of it. Rick Davis, McCain's campaign manager, and Steve Schmidt, a senior campaign adviser, pitched the conservative Palin to McCain as a veep possibility and, McCain writes, \"I was intrigued.\" A.B. Culverhouse, who was in charge of vetting running mates for McCain, called her a \"high risk, high reward\" choice. But Salter, a senior adviser and McCain's Restless Wave co-author, warned that Palin's \"scant exposure to national politics, and her self-admitted knowledge deficiency in national security issues, would undermine the experience advantage we had over Obama.\" Salter, who wanted McCain to pick Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, proved prescient: Palin's lack of political seasoning and feeble grasp of national and foreign-policy issues would prove to be a big liability in the presidential campaign. McCain critics continue to use his Palin choice to attack his judgment. May 9: John McCain: Senate should reject Gina Haspel for CIA director May 8: Orrin Hatch says he 'spoke out of turn' about McCain not wanting Trump at his funeral \"She stumbled in some interviews, and had a few misjudgments in the glare of the ceaseless spotlight and unblinking cameras,\" McCain writes. \"Those missteps, too, are on me. She didn't put herself on the ticket. I did. I asked her to go through an experience that was wearing me down, that wears every candidate down. I made mistakes and misjudgments, too.\" The disastrous White House meeting on the 2008 financial crisis was 'a waste of time' McCain's book also sheds light on another 2008 decision that in retrospect was ill-advised: his September 2008 return to Washington, D.C., as Congress was grappling with the financial meltdown. With the U.S. financial system in peril thanks to the subprime-mortgage crisis, McCain had already committed a major campaign gaffe that made him seem out of touch, saying that \"the fundamentals of our economy are strong.\" That remark was meant \"to say something encouraging that wouldn't contribute to the spreading panic,\" McCain says in The Restless Wave, but it \"proved colossally impolitic.\" May 6: John McCain is 'reflecting, in the end,' on his life, son-in-law Ben Domenech says May 5: John McCain, battling brain cancer, tells Biden to stay in politics McCain and his campaign advisers knew the housing-related crisis would doom any chance of victory unless McCain could somehow make it appear that he was part of the solution. Because his reaction to the financial turmoil \"wasn't cutting it,\" they \"hatched a plan,\" in McCain's words, to propose that he and Obama suspend their campaigns ahead of their first scheduled debate in Oxford, Miss., so the two candidates, in conjunction with the White House, could meet with House and Senate leaders to collaborate on a bipartisan \"rescue plan that could pass Congress.\" Obama and then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., resisted McCain. \"We had the White House meeting. It was a waste of time,\" McCain writes. \"Harry and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi just stirred the pot, blaming the crisis on Republicans. Barack spoke briefly. I went in knowing the House Republican votes for the rescue package weren't there. ... When asked by President Bush to speak, I said I would defer to the House Republican leader. I should have hogged the floor a little. Minutes after the meeting ended, press accounts quoted anonymous sources claiming I hadn't had anything to offer.\" The Sept. 25, 2008, White House meeting was worse than a mere waste of time. It perpetuated a perception that McCain was clueless about the economy. \"Our gambit failed and that cost us support we couldn't afford to lose,\" McCain writes. \"I wish we hadn't tried it, but I'll be damned if I can think of anything else we might have done that could have gained us support or limited the damage the crisis was doing to our campaign, which we were pretty sure would prove mortal.\" CLOSE Arizona Sen. John McCain insisted on the need for campaign-finance reform and spoke out against pork-barrel spending and government waste. His efforts ruffled feathers in the Senate and earned him the nickname of the 'maverick.' McCain is a Reagan, not a Trump or 'Breitbart,' Republican McCain reaffirms his Republican pedigree against far-right detractors who have long-branded him a \"RINO,\" or Republican In Name Only. McCain writes in the book that Democrats, including the late U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, courted him to switch parties in the aftermath of his 2000 loss in the Republican presidential primaries to then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who would go on to win the White House that year. May 1: John McCain in new book: 'I can speak my mind without fearing the consequences' April 29: McCain's son-in-law: 'John hugged me tonight. He asked me to take care of Meghan.' This happened at the height of McCain's \"maverick\" period, when he was a reliable thorn in Bush's side. McCain told The Arizona Republic last year that he never seriously considered abandoning the Republican Party. In the book, McCain acknowledges some \"hard feelings\" toward Bush after the 2000 election, but adds that he \"got over them a lot sooner than many people believed I had, and sooner than the lingering antagonism between our staffs had faded.\" While he disagreed with Bush on some key issues, such as his tax-cut package, McCain says he mostly agreed with Bush and found him likable. \"Last but not least, I was a Republican, a Reagan Republican,\" writes McCain, who first entered Congress while President Ronald Reagan held the Oval Office. \"Still am. Not a Tea Party Republican. Not a Breitbart Republican. Not a talk radio or Fox News Republican. Not an isolationist, protectionist, immigrant-bashing, scapegoating, get-nothing-useful-done Republican. Not, as I am often dismissed by self-declared 'real' conservatives, a RINO, Republican in Name Only. \"I'm a Reagan Republican, a proponent of lower taxes, less government, free markets, free trade, defense readiness, and democratic internationalism.\" Follow Dan Nowicki on Twitter:@dannowicki CLOSE After his 2008 presidential election defeat, John McCain resurrected \"the maverick\" upon his return to the Senate, opposing President Barack Obama, championing immigration reform and acting as a counterweight to GOP President Donald Trump.

{"global_context": "The United States has a longstanding policy of not negotiating with terrorists. And the Afghan Taliban isn’t on the State Department’s list of “Foreign Terrorist Organizations” (although, Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, its Pakistani counterpart, is) so it isn’t technically considered a terrorist organization. But after fighting it in Afghanistan in the “War on Terror” for almost 17 years, you’d be forgiven for mistaking it for one. So news of face-to-face peace talks between U.S. diplomats and the Afghan Taliban likely rubbed some people the wrong way. But talking with the Taliban is nothing new. The Obama administration started negotiations with the group in 2013. Those conversations led to the controversial Bowe Bergdahl trade. Now, as first reported by the Wall Street Journal, “The top U.S. envoy for South Asia met with Taliban officials [last] week to discuss ways to lay the groundwork for peace talks.” But these talks are also different in one important way. “Direct talks with the militants, without Afghan officials present, marks a major turnaround in Washington’s policy as it seeks to end America’s longest war,” the BBC reports. As the war in Afghanistan drags on, it brings us to our question of the week: Is it time to talk peace with the Taliban? Are we negotiating with terrorists? Does that even matter to you? Should the talks come with preconditions? Or should the United States be open to talking with the Taliban about peace at any time and any place? Should the United States insist that the Afghan government be involved? Or should U.S. diplomats concede to the Taliban’s demand for more direct talks between it and our government? The Taliban gave safe harbor to Osama bin Laden in the years leading up to the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks. Should we stay the course and see the Taliban destroyed? Or, as we near 17 years, has it been long enough? Can we still achieve peace with honor? Or should we just go home? Email your thoughts to opinion@scng.com.

Macron urged that there be no shift toward isolationism. \"Let me say we have two possible ways ahead. We can choose isolationism, withdrawal and nationalism. This is an option,\" Macron said. \"It can be tempting to us as a temporary remedy to our fears. But closing the door to the world will not stop the evolution of the world. It will not douse, but inflame, the fears of our citizens. We have to keep our eyes wide open to the new risks right in front of us.\" The French president addressed the \"ever-growing virus of fake news\" that he said “exposes our people to irrational fear and imaginary risks.\".

{"global_context": "In his statement to reporters, Tillerson stressed that U.S. leadership starts with diplomacy. Outgoing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson delivered a statement to reporters at the State Department after President Trump fired him Tuesday. Absent in his speech were remarks about Trump’s “America First” strategy or any comments about the president. Instead, Tillerson thanked State Department employees for their work regarding North Korea and stressed the importance of allies and partners. Here is what he said: Afternoon all. I received a call today from the president of the United States a little after noon time from Air Force One, and I've also spoken to White House Chief of Staff [John F.] Kelly to ensure we have clarity as to the days ahead. What is most important is to ensure an orderly and smooth transition during a time that the country continues to face significant policy and national security challenges. As such, effective at the end of the day, I'm delegating all responsibilities of the Office of the Secretary to Deputy Secretary of State [John J.] Sullivan. My commission as secretary of state will terminate at midnight, March 31. Between now and then, I will address a few administrative matters related to my departure and work towards a smooth and orderly transition for Secretary of State-designate Mike Pompeo. I’m encouraging my policy planning team and undersecretaries and assistant secretaries, those confirmed, as well as those in acting positions, to remain at their post and continue our mission at the State Department and working with the interagency process. I will be meeting members of my front office team and policy planning later today to thank them for their service. They have been extraordinarily dedicated to our mission, which includes promoting values that I view as being very important to the safety and security of our State Department personnel: accountability, which means treating each other with honesty and integrity, and respect for one another. Most recently, in particular, to address challenges of sexual harassment within the department. I want to speak now to my State Department colleagues and to our interagency colleagues and partners at DOD and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, most particularly, to my Foreign Service officers and civil service colleagues. We all take the same oath of office, whether you’re a career employee or a political appointee, we are all bound by that common commitment to support and defend the Constitution, to bear true faith and allegiance to the same, and to faithfully discharge the duties of our office. As a State Department, we are bound together by that oath. We remain steadfast here in Washington and in posts across the world, many of whom are in danger-placed situations without their families. The world needs selfless leaders like these: ready to work with long-standing allies, new emerging partners and allies, who now, many are struggling as democracies, and in some cases are dealing with human tragedy, crisis of natural disasters — literally crawling themselves out of those circumstances. These are experiences that no lecture hall in an academic environment or a think tank can teach you. Only by people going to the front lines to serve can they develop this kind of talent. To the men and women in uniform, I’m told for the first time in most people’s memory the Department of State and Department of Defense have a close working relationship where we all agree the U.S. leadership starts with diplomacy. The men and women in uniform at the Department of Defense and the leadership of Secretary [of Defense Jim] Mattis and Gen. [Joseph F.] Dunford protect us as Americans and our way of life daily, at home and abroad. As an all-volunteer military, they do it for the love of country, they do it for you, and they do it for me — and for no other reason. As Americans, we are all eternally grateful to each of them, and we honor their sacrifices. The rewarding part of having leadership and partnerships in place is that you can actually get some things done, and I want to give recognition to the State Department and our partners for a few of their accomplishments under this administration. First, working with allies, we exceeded the expectations of almost everyone with the DPRK maximum pressure campaign with the announcement on my very first trip as secretary of state to the region that the era of strategic patience was over, and we commenced the steps to dramatically increase not just the scope but the effectiveness of the sanctions. The department undertook a global campaign to bring partners and allies on board in every country around the world with every embassy and mission raising this to the highest levels, and in every meeting I’ve had throughout the year, this has been on the agenda to discuss: the adoption of the South Asia strategy, with a conditions-based military plan as the tool to compel the Taliban to reconciliation and peace talks with the Afghan government, finally equipped our military planners with a strategy which they can execute as opposed to a succession of 16 one-year strategies. This clear military commitment attracted the support of allies broadly and equipped our diplomats with a whole new level of certainty around how to prepare for the peace talks and achieve the final objectives. In other areas where progress has been made, much work remains. In Syria, we did achieve important cease-fires and stabilizations which we know has saved thousands of lives. There’s more to be done in Syria, particularly with respect to achieving the peace, as well as stabilizing Iraq, and seeing a healthy government installed more broadly in the entire global campaign to defeat ISIS. Nothing is possible without allies and partners, though. Much work remains to establish a clear view of the nature of our future relationship with China. How should we deal with one another over the next 50 years and ensure a period of prosperity for all of our peoples, free of conflict between two very powerful nations? And much work remains to respond to the troubling behavior and actions on the part of the Russian government. Russia must assess carefully as to how its actions are in the best interest of the Russian people and of the world more broadly. Continuing on their current trajectory is likely to lead to greater isolation on their part, a situation which is not in anyone’s interest. So to my colleagues in the State Department and the interagency: Much remains to be done to achieve our mission on behalf of the American people, with allies and with partners. I close by thanking all for the privilege of serving beside you for the last 14 months. Importantly, to the 300-plus million Americans: Thank you for your devotion to a free and open society, to acts of kindness towards one another, to honesty and the quiet hard work that you do every day to support this government with your tax dollars. All of us, we know, want to leave this place as a better place for the next generation. I now return to private life as a private citizen, as a proud American, proud of the opportunity I’ve had to serve my country. God bless all of you. God bless the American people. God bless America.

{"global_context": "By RAHIM FAIEZ and AMIR SHAH The Associated Press KABUL, Afghanistan — A suicide bomber struck a private education center in a Shiite neighborhood of Kabul on Wednesday where high school graduates were preparing for university entrance exams, killing 48 young men and women and leaving behind a scene of devastation and tragedy. The bombing, blamed on the Islamic State group, was the latest assault on Afghanistan’s Shiite community, which has increasingly been targeted by Sunni extremists who consider Shiites to be heretics. It also showed how militants are still able to stage large-scale attacks, even in the heart of Kabul, and underscored the struggles of the Afghan forces to provide security and stability on their own. The attack comes amid a particularly bloody week in Afghanistan that has seen Taliban attacks kill scores of Afghan troops and civilians. It was not immediately clear how the bomber managed to sneak into the building, used by the Shiite community as an education center, in the Dasht-i Barcha area of Kabul. The spokesman for the public health ministry, Wahid Majroh, said 67 people were also wounded in the bombing and that the death toll — which steadily rose in the immediate aftermath of the bombing — could rise further. He did not say if all the victims were students and whether any of their teachers were also among the casualties. Dawlat Hossain, father of 18-year-old student Fareba who had left her class just a few minutes before the bombing but was still inside the compound, was on his way to meet his daughter and started running when he heard the explosion. Hossain recounted to The Associated Press how when he entered Fareba’s classroom, he saw parts of human bodies all over student desks and benches. “There was blood everywhere, all over the room, so scary and horrible,” he said. After finding out that his daughter was safe, he helped move the wounded to hospitals. Fareba was traumatized that so many of her friends were killed, but Hossain said she was lucky to be alive. The explosion initially set off gunfire from Afghan guards in the area, leading to assumptions that there were more attackers involved, but officials later said all indications were that there was only one bomber. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack but Jawad Ghawari, a member of the city’s Shiite clerical council, blamed IS, which has carried similar attacks on Shiites in the past, hitting mosques, schools and cultural centers. In the past two years, there were at least 13 attacks on the Shiite community in Kabul alone, he said. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani condemned the “terrorist” attack that “martyred and wounded the innocent” — students attending class — and ordered an investigation into the attack. “By targeting educational and cultural centers, terrorists have clearly shown they are against all those Islamic principles (that strive) for both men and women to learn and study,” Ghani said in a statement. The head of the U.N. children’s agency denounced the attack, saying it’s “deplorable” that children continue to be hardest hit in the growing violence across Afghanistan. “Children are not, and must never be the target of violence,” said UNICEF’s executive director Henrietta Fore. Meanwhile, a Taliban assault on two adjacent checkpoints in northern Afghanistan late on Tuesday night killed at least 30 soldiers and policemen. The attack took place in Baghlan province’s Baghlan-I Markazi district, said Mohammad Safdar Mohseni, the head of the provincial council. Dilawar Aymaq, a parliamentarian from Baghlan, said the attack targeted a military checkpoint and another manned by the so-called local police, militias recruited and paid by the Interior Ministry. At least nine security forces were still missing and four others were wounded in the attack, said Abdul Hai Nemati, the governor of Baghlan. He said reinforcements have been dispatched to help recapture the checkpoints. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the assault. Life was gradually returning to normal Wednesday in parts of the eastern city of Ghazni after a massive, days-long Taliban attack, though sporadic gunbattles was still underway in some neighborhoods. The Taliban launched a coordinated offensive last Friday, overwhelming the city’s defenses and capturing several neighborhoods. Afghan forces repelled the initial assault and in recent days have struggled to flush the insurgents out of residential areas where they are holed up. The United States and NATO launched airstrikes and sent military advisers to aid Afghan forces as they fight for the city, just 75 miles from the Afghan capital with a population of some 270,000 people. At least 35 Ghazni civilians have been killed, said Arif Noori, a spokesman for the provincial governor. The wounded were still arriving at the city’s only hospital, which has been overwhelmed by casualties, he added. Hundreds of people have fled the fighting in Ghazni, which has also killed about 100 members of the Afghan security forces. Elsewhere in Afghanistan, the Taliban attacked a police checkpoint in the southern Zabul province early Wednesday, killing four policemen, according to the provincial police chief, Mustafa Mayar. The Taliban have seized several districts across the country in recent years and carry out near-daily attacks targeting Afghan security forces. The assault on Ghazni was widely seen as a show of force ahead of possible peace talks with the U.S., which has been at war in Afghanistan for nearly 17 years. Also Wednesday, six children were killed when they tinkered with an unexploded rocket shell, causing it to blow up, said Sarhadi Zwak, spokesman for the governor of the eastern Laghman province. The victims were girls, aged 10-12, who were gathering firewood, he said, blaming the Taliban. Afghanistan is littered with unexploded ordnance left by decades of war. It is also plagued by roadside bombs planted by insurgents, which are usually intended for government officials or security forces, but often kill and maim civilians. Associated Press writer Edith M.

{"global_context": "U.S. Senator John McCain, a former prisoner of war in Vietnam who ran unsuccessfully for president as a self-styled maverick Republican in 2008 and became a prominent critic of President Donald Trump, died on Saturday, his office said. He was 81. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator John McCain, a former prisoner of war in Vietnam who ran unsuccessfully for president as a self-styled maverick Republican in 2008 and became a prominent critic of President Donald Trump, died on Saturday, his office said. He was 81. McCain, a U.S. senator from Arizona for over three decades, had been battling glioblastoma, an aggressive brain cancer, discovered by his doctors in July 2017, and had not been at the U.S. Capitol in 2018. He also had surgery for an intestinal infection in April of this year. His family had announced on Friday that McCain was discontinuing further cancer treatment. A statement from his office on Saturday said: “Senator John Sidney McCain III died at 4:28 p.m. on August 25, 2018. With the senator when he passed were his wife Cindy and their family. At his death, he had served the United States of America faithfully for sixty years.” No further details were immediately provided. “My heart is broken. I am so lucky to have lived the adventure of loving this incredible man for 38 years,” Cindy McCain wrote on Twitter. “He passed the way he lived, on his own terms, surrounded by the people he loved, in the place he loved best.” The vacancy created by McCain’s death narrowed the Republican majority in the U.S. Senate to 50 seats in the 100-member upper chamber, with Democrats controlling 49 seats. But Republican Arizona Governor Doug Ducey is expected to appoint a member of his own party to succeed McCain. That could also give Republicans a slight edge in the battle to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court in the weeks ahead, as McCain had been too ill to cast any votes this year. Alternatively affable and cantankerous, McCain had been in the public eye since the 1960s, when as a naval aviator he was shot down during the Vietnam War and tortured by his North Vietnamese communist captors during 5-1/2 years as a prisoner. He was edged out by George W. Bush for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000, but became his party’s White House candidate eight years later. After gambling on political neophyte Sarah Palin as his vice presidential running mate, McCain lost in 2008 to Democrat Barack Obama, who became the first black U.S. president. Paying tribute to his onetime election opponent, Obama said in a statement that he and McCain, despite their “completely different backgrounds,” and political differences, shared “a fidelity to something higher - the ideals for which generations of Americans and immigrants alike have fought, marched and sacrificed.” “We saw our political battles, even, as a privilege, something noble, an opportunity to serve as stewards of those high ideals at home, and to advance them around the world,” Obama wrote. Defense Secretary James Mattis saluted McCain as a figure who “always put service to the nation before self,” and “represented what he believed, that ‘a shared purpose does not claim our identity - on the contrary - it enlarges your sense of self.’” McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, remained prominent during and after the last White House race as both a frequent critic and target of his fellow Republican, Trump, who was elected president in November 2016. McCain denounced Trump for among other things his praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin and other leaders the senator described as foreign “tyrants.” “Flattery secures his friendship, criticism his enmity,” McCain said of Trump in his memoir, “The Restless Wave,” which was released in May. McCain in July had castigated Trump for his summit with Putin, issuing a statement that called their joint news conference in Helsinki “one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory.” He said Trump was “not only unable but unwilling to stand up to Putin.” Sources close to McCain have said Trump would not be invited to the funeral. Shortly after McCain’s death was announced, Trump tweeted: My deepest sympathies and respect go out to the family of Senator John McCain.” McCain, a foreign policy hawk with a traditional Republican view of world affairs, was admired in both parties for championing civility and compromise during an era of acrid partisanship in U.S. politics. But he also had a famous temper and rarely shied away from a fight. He had several with Trump. THUMBS-DOWN He was the central figure in one of the most dramatic moments in Congress of Trump’s presidency when he returned to Washington shortly after his brain cancer diagnosis for a middle-of-the-night Senate vote in July 2017. Still bearing a black eye and scar from surgery, McCain gave a thumbs-down signal in a vote to scuttle a Trump-backed bill that would have repealed the Obamacare healthcare law and increased the number of Americans without health insurance by millions. Trump was furious about McCain’s vote and frequently referred to it at rallies, but without mentioning McCain by name. After Trump in 2015 launched his presidential campaign, McCain condemned his hard-line rhetoric on illegal immigration and said Trump had “fired up the crazies.” Trump retorted that McCain was “not a war hero,” adding: “I like people who weren’t captured.” After Trump became president, McCain blasted what he called the president’s attempts to undermine the free press and rule of law, and lamented the “half-baked, spurious nationalism” of the Trump era. McCain denounced Trump’s performance at a summit meeting with Putin in July as “a tragic mistake,” adding, “The damage inflicted by President Trump’s naivete, egotism, false equivalence, and sympathy for autocrats is difficult to calculate.” MCCAIN VS OBAMA McCain, the son and grandson of U.S. Navy admirals, was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Arizona in 1982 after more than two decades of Navy service. He served four years in the House before Arizona voters elected him to the Senate in 1986 to replace Barry Goldwater, the 1964 Republican presidential nominee revered by conservatives. In running for president in 2008, McCain tried to succeed an unpopular fellow Republican in Bush, who was leaving office with the country mired in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and stuck in a financial crisis. It was a stark contrast between McCain, then a 72-year-old veteran of the Washington establishment, and the 47-year-old Obama, who was offering a “Yes, we can” message of change. McCain tried to inject some youth and enthusiasm into his campaign with his selection of Palin, Alaska’s governor, as his running mate. But the choice backfired as her political inexperience and shaky performances in media interviews raised concerns about her qualifications. In his new book, McCain voiced regret for not choosing then-Senator Joe Lieberman, a Democrat turned independent, as his running mate. McCain wrote that he had originally settled on Lieberman, Democrat Al Gore’s running mate in the 2000 election, but was warned by Republican leaders that Lieberman’s views on social issues, including support for abortion rights, would “fatally divide” the party. FILE PHOTO - Republican presidential hopeful John McCain points to his head during his Carolina kickoff rally at Presbyterian College February 2, 2000. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo “It was sound advice that I could reason for myself,” McCain wrote. “But my gut told me to ignore it and I wish I had.” Obama won 53 percent of the vote to McCain’s 45.6 percent. WAR INJURIES During the Vietnam War, McCain flew attack planes off aircraft carriers. He was preparing for a bombing run in 1967 when a missile inadvertently fired from another plane hit his fuel tanks, triggering a fatal explosion and fire. He suffered shrapnel wounds. A few months later on Oct. 26, 1967, McCain’s A-4 Skyhawk was shot down on a bombing mission over North Vietnam’s capital and he suffered two broken arms and a broken leg in the crash. A mob then dragged him from a lake, broke his shoulder and stabbed him. Held at the notorious “Hanoi Hilton” prison and other sites, McCain was beaten and tortured, suffering broken bones and dysentery. He was released on March 14, 1973, but was left with permanent infirmities. In Congress, McCain built a generally conservative record, opposing abortion and advocating higher defense spending. He supported Bush’s 2003 invasion of Iraq and criticized Obama for not doing more to intervene in Syria’s civil war. Still, he prided himself on his reputation as a maverick and had a history of working across party lines on immigration, climate change and campaign finance reform. He also spoke out against the Bush administration’s use of waterboarding, a torture technique that simulates drowning, and other harsh interrogation tactics on detainees in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. He urged the closure of the prison for foreign terrorism suspects at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and also sponsored an anti-torture measure that passed Congress in 2005. In a 2002 memoir, McCain wrote, “I’m an independent-minded, well-informed public servant to some. And to others, I’m a self-styled, self-righteous maverick pain in the ass.” McCain was born on Aug. 29, 1936, at an American naval installation in the Panama Canal Zone - U.S. territory at the time - when his father was stationed there. He conceded he was a “smart ass” during his years at the U.S. Naval Academy and graduated fifth from the bottom of his class. McCain divorced his wife Carol after 15 years of marriage in 1980 and weeks later married the former Cindy Henley, daughter of a wealthy beer distributor in Arizona. A dark period for McCain came as one of the “Keating Five” group of senators accused of improperly intervening with federal regulators to help political contributor and bank executive Charles Keating, whose Lincoln Savings and Loan failed in 1989 at a cost to taxpayers of $3.4 billion. McCain was cleared of wrongdoing in 1991, but the Senate Ethics Committee rebuked him for poor judgment. On July 25, 2017, McCain delivered a Senate floor speech not long after his cancer diagnosis that was widely seen as his farewell address. It included a call to fellow Republicans to stand up to Trump and for all lawmakers to work together to keep America as a “beacon of liberty” in the world. “That is the cause that binds us and is so much more powerful and worthy than the small differences that divide us,” McCain said.

{"global_context": "A new poll shows a large number of Americans don't want Trump for a second term. Former vice president Joe Biden is getting winks and nudges to declare his political ambitions for 2020. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) More than half of Americans are uninterested in keeping President Trump around for a second term, according to a new poll. But to be fair, considering his historically low approval ratings, this is not that surprising. But what is surprising is who Americans want as the next president — and who they don't. A recent Quinnipiac poll says that more Americans would vote for former vice president Joe Biden than Trump. It certainly wouldn't be a landslide win: 48 percent of respondents said they'd pick Biden, while 44 percent said they'd elect the president for a second term. Biden has not ruled out running in 2020, after opting not to enter the race in 2016, citing the death of his son Beau Biden and a need to focus on family. But, if elected, Biden would be 78 years old when entering the White House. The former vice president ranks at No. 2 behind Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on The Fix's list of top 2020 contenders. While Biden is No. 2 on the list, it's not as firmly as before, after a recent spate of sexual harassment allegations against politicians — and the reevaluation of past allegations — put Biden's handling of the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings back in the spotlight, Aaron Blake reported. And speaking of the #MeToo movement, the buzz around Oprah Winfrey after her campaign-style speech during the Golden Globes, confirmed that she would beat the president. According to the poll, she would get 52 percent of the vote to Trump's 39 percent. But 66 percent of respondents said electing a celebrity as president is a bad idea. One particular lawmaker who is considered a front-runner by many liberals would not appear to have the support needed to beat Trump: Sanders. When asked whether they’d be inclined to vote for Sanders over Trump, 55 percent of those surveyed said no. It has become a common argument on the left when lamenting Trump that had Sanders been the Democratic nominee over Hillary Clinton, he would have attracted enough support to beat Trump. The argument is that liberals who did not back Clinton would have voted for Sanders, along with some of the white working-class voters and men who ultimately chose Trump. However, this most recent poll suggests that would not be the case today. The poll also revealed potential support for Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, the lawmaker from New York who holds Clinton’s former seat in the Senate. When asked whether they would be inclined to vote for Gillibrand, 49 percent of Americans said “no” while only 13 percent said “yes.” Gillibrand's name has been thrown around as a possible 2020 candidate and has attracted quite a bit of attention recently for public stances on sexual misconduct. She helped lead the call for former senator Al Franken (D-Minn.) to resign following allegations of sexual misconduct and even said former president Bill Clinton should have resigned, which sent shock waves through Democratic circles. Gillibrand has also spoken out in support of single-payer health care, a policy Sanders pushed during the 2016 campaign. The survey did not poll Americans on other hypothetical 2020 candidates, including Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) or Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.). But what is clear is that more than half of Americans seem uninterested in allowing Trump to remain in the White House for another term. In a question in which no opponent is named, 62 percent of respondents said that they would not be inclined to vote for Trump; 34 percent said they would. “President Donald Trump can’t seem to improve his approval rating, perhaps because of the troubling fact that half of the voters we spoke to think he is mentally unstable,” said Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll. “The president is a divider, not a uniter, say an overwhelming number of voters, an assessment made even more disturbing by his perceived lack of respect for people of color.”.

{"global_context": "Sarah Sanders lashed out at the press while declining to answer whether she agreed with President Trump's use of \"enemy of the people\" to describe reporters. Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. WASHINGTON — White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders lashed out at the press on Thursday while declining to directly answer whether she agreed with President Donald Trump's repeated use of the phrase \"enemy of the people\" to describe members of the media. The New York Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger said he confronted Trump over the phrase last month in a meeting, citing it as an example of \"inflammatory language [that] is contributing to a rise in threats against journalists and will lead to violence.\" Pressed by CNN's Jim Acosta, who has often clashed with the White House, to personally distance herself from the term given her role as a public liaison to the press, Sanders said \"the president has made his position known.\" She then went on to criticize Acosta and other outlets over an array of topics. \"It's ironic, Jim, that not only you and the media attack the president for his rhetoric, when they frequently lower the level of conversation in this country,\" Sanders said. \"Repeatedly, repeatedly, the media resorts to personal attacks without any content other than to incite anger. The media has attacked me personally on a number of occasions, including your own network, said I should be harassed as a life sentence, that I should be choked.\" The \"choked\" line was a reference to MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace, who apologized in May for \"poorly chosen words\" after she asked a reporter after a press briefing, “How do you resist the temptation to run up and wring her neck?\" Wallace said the phrase was meant to evoke exasperation with Sanders' response to questions about a White House staffer who reportedly joked about cancer-stricken Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., dying. Sanders also referred to the White House Correspondents Association's annual dinner this year, in which comedian Michelle Wolf mocked her in a speech. Wolf is not a member of the White House press and comedians traditionally use the event to poke fun at political figures, but the WHCA nonetheless condemned her comments, which critics said went too far by touching on her physical appearance. Relations between the press and the White House have been especially sour in recent weeks. The administration blocked a CNN correspondent from an event after she shouted questions to the president at an event, a routine practice among correspondents, while serving as the White House pool reporter. The WHCA strongly condemned the move, with president Olivier Knox calling it \"wholly inappropriate, wrong-headed, and weak.\" Sanders was previously asked on Wednesday whether the White House thought it was appropriate for Trump supporters to heckle reporters at a rally in Tampa this week. She responded that the White House condemns violence, but also criticized news outlets over a decades-old accusation that a newspaper revealed key intelligence about Osama bin Laden's use of a satellite phone in the 1990s that damaged efforts to capture or kill him. The Washington Post reported in 2005 and again this week that the claim, while widely repeated after 9/11, is unlikely to be true. Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter and a White House aide, said at an Axios event on Thursday that she doesn't agree with the \"enemy of the people\" tag. “I’ve certainly received my fair share of reporting on me personally that I know not to be fully accurate, so I have some sensitivity around why people have concerns and gripes, especially when they sort of feel targeted, but no, I do not consider the media the enemy of the people,\" she said. The president responded to his daughter's comments on Twitter, claiming their views are actually in alignment.

The men said that their home country’s revoking of their citizenship denies them fair trial. “The Beatles” terror cell is believed to have captured, tortured and killed hostages including American, British and Japanese journalists and aid workers. (Hussein Malla/Associated Press) KOBANI, Syria — Two British members of the Islamic State group believed to have belonged to a cell notorious for beheading hostages in northern Syria said Friday that their home country’s revoking of their citizenship denies them the possibility of fair trial. One of them said the killings of captives was “regrettable” and could have been avoided. The men were allegedly among four British jihadis who made up the IS cell nicknamed “The Beatles” by surviving captives because of their English accents. The cell became known for its brutality, holding in captivity more than 20 Western hostages, and torturing and killing several, including American, British and Japanese journalists and aid workers, in 2014 and 2015. The two men, El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Amon Kotey, spoke to The Associated Press from their detention Friday in northern Syria in their first interview with the media. They were captured in early January in eastern Syria by the Kurdish-led U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces amid the collapse of IS. Though they spoke of their membership in the Islamic State group, they did not admit to belonging to the cell or to have been involved in any of the kidnappings or killings. Elsheikh called the allegations “propaganda.” Asked about the beheadings of American journalist James Foley and other victims, Kotey said many in IS “would have disagreed” with the killings “on the grounds that there is probably more benefit in them being political prisoners.” “As for my position, I didn’t see any benefit. It was something that was regrettable,” he added. He also blamed Western governments for failing to negotiate, noting that some hostages were released for ransoms. The leader of the cell, Mohammed Emwazi, was dubbed “Jihadi John” in the British media after he appeared, masked, in a string of videos showing beheadings of the hostages. He was killed in a U.S.-led coalition drone strike in 2015 in the Syrian city of Raqqa, the de facto IS capital. Another member, Aine Lesley Davis, was arrested in Turkey and convicted there in 2017, sentenced to seven years in prison. Elsheikh, whose family came to Britain from Sudan when he was a child, was a mechanic from White City in west London. Kotey, who is of Ghanaian and Greek-Cypriot descent and converted to Islam in his 20s, is from London’s Paddington neighborhood. Both have been interrogated by U.S. officials since their capture. Elsheikh traveled to Syria in 2012, initially joining al-Qaida’s branch before moving on to IS, according to the U.S. State Department’s listing of the two men for terrorism sanctions. It said he “earned a reputation for waterboarding, mock executions and crucifixions while serving as an (IS) jailer.” Kotey served as a guard for the execution cell and “likely engaged in the group’s executions and exceptionally cruel torture methods, including electronic shock and waterboarding,” the State Department said. In the interview, the two men denounced the media for the spreading allegations of the “Beatles” cell, at one point depicting the accusations as concocted as a pretext to kill them with drone strikes in Syria. “No fair trial, when I am ‘the Beatle’ in the media. No fair trial,” Elsheikh said. They also denounced as “illegal” the British government’s decision in February to strip them of citizenship. The decision was widely reported in British media, though officials have not confirmed or denied it, citing privacy rules. The revocation of citizenship exposes them to “rendition and torture,” Elsheikh said, “being taken to any foreign land and treated in anyway and having nobody to vouch for you.” “When you have these two guys who don’t even have any citizenship ...if we just disappear one day, where is my mom going to go and say where is my son,” he said. The capture of the two men has sparked a debate over where and how to prosecute them. The U.S. has been pressing for the home countries of foreign jihadis in Iraq and Syria to take their nationals for trial. Britain’s defense secretary has said they should not be allowed back into the country. Former captives of the cell and families of its victims have called on Elsheikh and Kotey to be given a fair trial, whether in the United States or Britain. Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

{"global_context": "Senate Republicans are bringing in a female prosecutor from Arizona with decades of experience prosecuting sex crimes to handle questioning about allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, describing her as tough, experienced and objective. Rachel Mitchell, a Republican, was expected to question both Kavanaugh and the first woman to accuse him of sexual misconduct at Thursday's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that Kavanaugh drunkenly assaulted her when they were teenagers has predictably raised a political storm in the #MeToo era and the GOP's all-male presence on the panel made some want a woman to question Ford. Allegations from two other women have since emerged, but Republicans have not announced any plans to focus Thursday's session on those claims. Kavanaugh has denied all the accusations. Mitchell works in the Maricopa County Attorney's Office in Phoenix as the chief of the Special Victims Division. She supervises attorneys who handle cases involving child molestation, sexual assault and computer crimes against children in Arizona's most populous county. Mitchell \"has been recognized in the legal community for her experience and objectivity,\" committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, said in a statement Tuesday. Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery, Mitchell's boss, praised her experience in an interview with The Arizona Republic , calling her an \"objective prosecutor\" who has a \"caring heart\" for victims. He said he was contacted by staff members of the Judiciary Committee over the weekend about Mitchell's qualifications. In July 2014, Mitchell prosecuted a former church baby sitter and camp counselor in the Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale who molested children in his care over a seven-year period. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison with lifetime probation. \"People want to go to a church on a Sunday and feel safe,\" Mitchell said at the time, adding that the settings of his actions \"should be taken into account.\" In 2015, Mitchell prosecuted a 13-year veteran of the Mesa Police Department who groped two women, one of whom had passed out. She has been named Arizona's Outstanding Sexual Assault Prosecutor as well as Maricopa County Attorney's Office Prosecutor of the Year. The county attorney's office introduced a sex crimes protocol last year — the first in its history. The new policy manual will ensure that prosecutors have a guide \"so that we can do the best we can for victims,\" Mitchell told a local NPR station in January. \"It's always hard to know which victims were not victims or which people were not victims because your system worked,\" Mitchell said in an interview with Phoenix radio station KJZZ.

{"global_context": "The Supreme Court ruled in favor of President Trump’s immigration policy in a 5-4 decision on Tuesday, holding that the entry restrictions from seven terror-prone nations codified in Presidential Proclamation 9645 is consistent with federal law and the Constitution’s Establishment Clause. WASHINGON, DC – The Supreme Court ruled in favor of President Trump and his “extreme vetting” immigration policy across the board in a 5-4 decision on Tuesday, holding that the permanent entry restrictions from seven terror-prone nations codified in Presidential Proclamation 9645 is fully consistent with Congress’s Immigration and Nationality Act as well as the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution. “The Proclamation is squarely within the scope of Presidential authority,” the Court declared in its opinion authored by Chief Justice John Roberts. “Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, foreign nationals seeking entry into the United States undergo a vetting process to ensure that they satisfy the numerous requirements for admission,” Roberts began. “The Act also vests the President with authority to restrict the entry of aliens whenever he finds that their entry would be detrimental to the interests of the United States,” quoting 8 U. S. C. §1182(f). “Relying on that delegation, the President concluded that it was necessary to impose entry restrictions on nationals of countries that do not share adequate information for an informed entry determination, or that otherwise present national security risks,” he continued, quoting the language of Presidential Proclamation 9645. “To further that purpose, the Proclamation placed entry restrictions on the nationals of eight foreign states whose systems for managing and sharing information about their nationals the President deemed inadequate,” Roberts added. “The Proclamation exempts lawful permanent residents and foreign nationals who have been granted asylum,” the Court continued. “It also provides for case-by-case waivers when a foreign national demonstrates undue hardship, and that his entry is in the national interest and would not pose a threat to public safety.” The plaintiffs in the case argued that Proclamation 9645 is not authorized by the Immigration and National Act (INA). “The INA establishes numerous grounds on which an alien abroad may be inadmissible to the United States and ineligible for a visa,” the opinion explains. “Congress has also delegated to the President authority to suspend or restrict the entry of aliens in certain circumstances,” the majority added. “The principal source of that authority, §1182(f), enables the President to ‘suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens’ whenever he ‘finds’ that their entry ‘would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.’” “By its plain language, §1182(f) grants the President broad discretion to suspend the entry of aliens into the United States,” the Supreme Court held. “The President lawfully exercised that discretion based on his findings—following a worldwide, multi-agency review—that entry of the covered aliens would be detrimental to the national interest.” “By its terms, §1182(f) exudes deference to the President in every clause. It entrusts to the President the decisions whether and when to suspend entry,” Roberts wrote. “The Proclamation falls well within this comprehensive delegation.” The plaintiffs also argued that Presidential Proclamation 9645 violates the Establishment Clause in the First Amendment of the Constitution, which provides, “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.” “Our cases recognize that the clearest command of the Establishment Clause is that one religious denomination cannot be officially preferred over another,” Roberts began that part of the opinion. “Plaintiffs believe that the Proclamation violates this prohibition by singling out Muslims for disfavored treatment,” the Court explained. “The entry suspension, they contend, operates as a ‘religious gerrymander,’ in part because most of the countries covered by the Proclamation have Muslim-majority populations.” The challengers “argue that this President’s words strike at fundamental standards of respect and tolerance, in violation of our constitutional tradition. But the issue before us is not whether to denounce the statements,” Roberts reasoned. “It is instead the significance of those statements in reviewing a Presidential directive, neutral on its face, addressing a matter within the core of executive responsibility.” “For more than a century, this Court has recognized that the admission and exclusion of foreign nationals is a fundamental sovereign attribute exercised by the Government’s political departments largely immune from judicial control,” the Court declared. “Nonetheless, although foreign nationals seeking admission have no constitutional right to entry, this Court has engaged in a circumscribed judicial inquiry when the denial of a visa allegedly burdens the constitutional rights of a U. S. citizen,” the justices noted. “Given the authority of the political branches over admission, we held that when the Executive exercises this delegated power negatively on the basis of a facially legitimate and bona fide reason,” the majority explained, “the courts will neither look behind the exercise of that discretion, nor test it by balancing its justification against the asserted constitutional interests of U.S. citizens.” The Court held that when it comes to immigration decisions, its 1972 Establishment Clause case Kleindienst v. Mandel sets forth the proper test, which requires a “deferential standard of review across different contexts and constitutional claims.” “Mandel’s narrow standard of review has particular force in admission and immigration cases that overlap with the area of national security,” Roberts wrote. “Judicial inquiry into the national-security realm raises concerns for the separation of powers by intruding on the President’s constitutional responsibilities in the area of foreign affairs.” The Supreme Court declared: The upshot of our cases in this context is clear: “Any rule of constitutional law that would inhibit the flexibility” of the President “to respond to changing world conditions should be adopted only with the greatest caution,” and our inquiry into matters of entry and national security is highly constrained. “More fundamentally, plaintiffs and the dissent challenge the entry suspension based on their perception of its effectiveness and wisdom. They suggest that the policy is overbroad and does little to serve national security interests,” Roberts noted. “But we cannot substitute our own assessment for the Executive’s predictive judgments on such matters, all of which are delicate, complex, and involve large elements of prophecy.” Justice Anthony Kennedy filed a concurring opinion in addition to joining the Court’s majority opinion, writing separately to encourage the political branches of government to aspire to unifying and welcoming rhetoric on divisive issues that arise in this context. Kennedy added that as this case now goes back to the lower courts for gathering evidence and further consideration, “It would be necessary to determine that any discovery and other preliminary matters would not themselves intrude on the foreign affairs power of the Executive.” Justice Clarence Thomas likewise joined the majority opinion, then wrote a lengthy concurrence, first making the point that “the Establishment Clause does not create an individual right to be free from all laws that a reasonable observer views as religious or antireligious.” Thomas focused most of his attention on the growing trend of individual federal trial courts issuing orders blocking the Trump administration. “District courts, including the one here, have begun imposing universal injunctions without considering their authority to grant such sweeping relief,” Thomas wrote: These injunctions are beginning to take a toll on the federal court system— preventing legal questions from percolating through the federal courts, encouraging forum shopping, and making every case a national emergency for the courts and for the Executive Branch. “In sum, universal injunctions are legally and historically dubious. If federal courts continue to issue them, this Court is dutybound to adjudicate their authority to do so,” he concluded. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote a vigorous dissent, joined by Justice Elena Kagan. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote an even more impassioned dissent, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. In her dissent, Sotomayor compared Tuesday’s decision to the Supreme Court’s 1945 decision in Korematsu v. United States, where the Court upheld holding Japanese-Americans in internment camps during World War II. Chief Justice Roberts took great exception to that comparison, writing for the majority, “Whatever rhetorical advantage the dissent may see in doing so, Korematsu has nothing to do with this case.” “The forcible relocation of U.S. citizens to concentration camps, solely and explicitly on the basis of race, is objectively unlawful and outside the scope of Presidential authority,” Roberts continued. “But it is wholly inapt to liken that morally repugnant order to a facially neutral policy denying certain foreign nationals the privilege of admission [into the United States.]” The case now goes back to the lower courts for additional proceedings, but the Supreme Court’s holdings on these legal issues are now permanently binding as a precedent of the Court. The case is Trump v. Hawaii, No. 17-965 in the Supreme Court of the United States. Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter @kenklukowski.

Brantley/ Defense Department) Defense Secretary Jim Mattis gave a full-throated defense Friday of U.S. efforts to prevent civilian casualties in the conflict in Yemen, making the case that without American involvement, there would be more. Mattis, speaking to reporters at the Pentagon, said that “it’s a tragedy every time” a civilian dies, but that the United States is held to a high standard when it comes to preventing civilian fatalities. “We are being held to a standard – ‘we’ being us and anyone associated with us – that has never been achieved before in warfare,” he said. The comments came after two separate airstrikes on Dec. 26 by a Saudi-led coalition fighting Houthi rebels in Yemen killed dozens of people and prompted a rebuke from a top United Nations official in the country. Initial U.N. reports said that at least 54 civilians, including eight children, were killed in a strike on a crowded market, and an additional 14 people from one family were killed in a bombing on a farm. The United States does not drop bombs as a part of the Saudi-led air war against the Houthis, but provides aerial refueling to Saudi jets, shares intelligence to improve their targeting and attempts to teach Saudi pilots how to be more accurate. Mattis bristled Friday when a reporter suggested that the effort isn’t working, saying “that’s your call.” Asked whether he was “okay” with the current level of civilian casualties, the defense secretary grew stern. “I’m never okay with any civilian casualty,” he said. “Don’t screw with me on this.” The U.S. military’s handling of civilian casualties has remained in question in several war zones in which the U.S. military operates, especially as it touts the campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as the most precise in world history. An extensive New York Times investigation published in November found that about 1 in 5 airstrikes in a sampling of 150 bombing sites surveyed by the Times resulted in a civilian death, with many uncounted by the coalition. Mattis said that in Yemen, the Saudi government is attacking Houthi rebels “with military necessity in their minds.” The rebels have launched numerous ballistic missiles over the Yemeni border into Saudi Arabia. The United States targets Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) militants in Yemen, but has mostly avoided targeting the Houthis themselves. One exception occurred in October 2016, when the Navy launched “limited self-defense strikes” using Tomahawk missiles at rebel radar sites after several missiles were launched at Navy ships. [Navy launches Tomahawk missiles at rebel sites in Yemen after attacks on U.S. ships] The war between the Saudis and Houthis dates back to March 2015, when the Saudis intervened on behalf of Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi after the Houthis attempted to overthrow him. Mattis said the U.S. military will continue to work with Saudi pilots to improve their bombing and target identification. He noted that other military forces that are part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) required U.S. assistance as they struggled to prevent civilian casualties in their operations in Libya after the 2011 U.S.-led intervention there. “Not all nations can be held to the standard that we’ve achieved,” Mattis said. Mattis visited the press center in the Pentagon to wish journalists a Happy New Year, and unexpectedly went on the record in a wide-ranging conversation that lasted about 45 minutes. The defense secretary said he expects more U.S. civilians involved in the reconstruction effort in Syria in 2018, including contractors and “more diplomats.” The effort, he said, will be geared toward stabilizing the country, with the U.S. military in a support role to provide security and transportation. “It is an attempt to move toward the normalcy and that takes a lot of support,” Mattis said. Mattis also predicted that more conventional U.S. troops will take on missions that were once the province of Special Operations forces in 2018 — an effort to reduce deployments of the Pentagon’s most elite forces after years of heavy use. “If I was to put it in philosophical terms, you want a force that can deal with today’s challenges and not be dominant in yesterday’s challenges,” Mattis said. “The general-purpose forces are going to have to have some of the capabilities that you and I used to only associate with Special Forces.” He added that over time, capabilities once associated with Special Operations troops have transitioned to being conventional military missions. In one example, a new Army Security Force Assistance Advisory Brigade is expected to deploy in the spring, training Afghan forces as part of an increase in U.S. troop deployments approved by President Trump. Mattis declined to offer any message to transgender people who might seek to enlist in the military beginning Jan. 1, when a federal court has ordered the Pentagon to allow them to do so. That came in response to legal challenges to President Trump’s proposed ban on all transgender people serving. “I’m not going to get into this right now,” Mattis said. “It’s a court case right now. The Department of Justice is handling it. If they’re not appealing it, we’ll be notified of that. And I don’t get into singling out and welcoming this group or that group or that gender or anything else. That’s not my role.” Asked how he feels about his first year as defense secretary, Mattis played it coy. “I don’t have any feelings,” he said, deadpan. As to whether he planned to stay in office through Trump’s term, he replied: “I take one day at a time.”.

The election due in April pits incumbent Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo against former general and ultranationalist Prabowo Subianto, who lost to Jokowi in 2014. Dressed in traditional clothing, the candidates and their running mates paraded through central Jakarta on Sunday and released doves at a ceremony after reading out a peaceful campaign declaration. The 2014 presidential election was marred by dirty campaigning and wild internet rumors that Jokowi was a secret communist and of Chinese background, accusations often used in Indonesia to discredit or intimidate political opponents. Jokowi, the first Indonesian president from outside the country's political and military elite, has picked conservative cleric Ma'ruf Amin as his running mate, aiming to neutralize criticism that he is insufficiently Muslim. He has a big but not unassailable lead over Prabowo in polls and Indonesia's recent hosting of the Asian Games further burnished his image. With a population of more than 260 million, Muslim majority Indonesia is the world's third-largest democracy after India and the U.S. The country's image as a moderate Muslim nation has been undermined by flaring intolerance in the past several years, from the imprisonment of Jakarta's Christian governor, who was a Jokowi ally, for blasphemy to the canings of gay men in Aceh, a province that practices Shariah law. Most of Jokowi's five-year term has been spent balancing the demands of his moderate base, powerful Islamic conservatives, a complicated parliamentary coalition and the military, which has never completely accepted its diminished role following the end of the Suharto dictatorship two decades ago. Upgrading Indonesia's creaking infrastructure has been his signature policy but progress is uneven and many Indonesians still yearn for the strong-man type leadership represented by Suharto era figures such as Prabowo.

{"global_context": "The president is the living embodiment of a spiraling crisis of American corruption, but the problem is far bigger than just him. The Trump presidency is the apotheosis of the crooked class, a monster made from our mistakes, and he’s making them worse. Under Mr. Trump, the I.R.S. has been starved of resources, audits of big corporations and the wealthy are down, and big banks and corporations have been given more leeway to rip people off with impunity. If we survive this reign of error, we need to learn our lesson and make it right. We should have seen this coming. The president’s father, Fred Trump, built a real estate empire with the help of government housing subsidies and industrial-scale tax evasion. Donald used this pilfered inheritance to build a myth of capitalist self-creation and rode it all the way to the White House. This trajectory would have been impossible if not for a labyrinthine tax system especially vulnerable to book-cooking scam artists like the Trumps. When it’s easy for a class of people to cheat and get away with it, over time, lots of them will. When their ranks and resources hit a critical mass, their desire for political cover can get traction. Their pooled wealth, much of which has been illicitly withheld from the system, can be deployed to incrementally change the system — to rig the tax code and its enforcement — to keep themselves in the money (and out of jail). This starves the government of funds for the public goods and social insurance programs that ensure our institutions work to the benefit of everyone, not just a cabal of the well-connected. If the legal and fiscal foundations of the country continue to erode, the rule of law can unravel in a doom loop of corruption, distrust and institutional degeneration. Collapsing public faith in government offers alert demagogues an opening to grab political power by promising to stick it to corrupt elites. As often as not, these will be corrupt elites eager to exploit a populist mandate to plunder with ever greater impunity. This happens the world over, again and again, and it happened to us. Mr. Trump is using the presidency to cover up his crimes, feather his nest and protect the interests of dictators who funnel money to his family.

{"global_context": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will testify before a Senate committee Wednesday about President Trump's meetings with the leaders of Russia and North Korea. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will testify Wednesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on President Trump's meetings with the leaders of Russia and North Korea. (Photo: Geert Vanden Wijngaert/AP) WASHINGTON — Congressional hearings aren’t usually must-watch TV. But Wednesday’s Senate grilling of Mike Pompeo, President Trump’s Secretary of State, could have viewers on the edge of their seats. That’s because Trump has angered European allies, held a private tete-a-tete with Russian President Vladimir Putin and pushed ahead on tariffs that are controversial with many lawmakers. All of this could make for political fireworks when Pompeo visits Capitol Hill. Trump’s meeting in Helsinki with Putin is likely to dominate the hearing. More than a week later, it’s not clear what, if anything, the two men agreed to during their two-hour, closed door conversation. Here’s your guide to watching Pompeo’s testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: So many Russia questions, so little time Russia has been a fraught topic since Day 1 for the Trump Administration. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded, in January 2017 report, that the Kremlin interfered with the 2016 presidential election in an effort to bolster Trump's prospects. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating Russia's role in the presidential contest – and whether Trump's campaign colluded with Putin's government. Trump seemed to exacerbate those concernslast week when, standing next to Putin at a joint news conference, he downplayed the U.S. intelligence assessment of Russia's role in the election and suggested he believed Putin's assertions that Russia didn't meddle. Trump has since tried to walk back those remarks, but Pompeo will almost certainly be pressed to detail Russia's past and current efforts to undermine American democracy. The bigger question about the Trump-Putin summit will be: What did Trump say to the Russian leader in private, before their public news conference? . “All of us are worried about what was promised,\" said Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., a member of the committee. \"I mean whether it has to do with military exercises, troop placement, NATO expansion, we just don’t know.\" And Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., another committee member, said he plans to ask about Trump's decision, announced last week, to invite Putin to Washington for a second meeting this fall. Coons said he does not think it's \"wise to invite President Putin to American soil,\" and will press Pompeo on the possible risks. Those questions may have Pompeo squirming. For one thing, it's not clear how much the secretary knows about Trump's private conversation with Putin. The only people allowed in that meeting were the two leaders and their interpreters. More broadly, Pompeo will need to demonstrate a realistic assessment of the threat Russia poses to the U.S. and its allies, without seeming to contradict Trump or appear disloyal. Remember the North Korea summit in Singapore? Before Trump had his private meeting with Putin, he held a closed-door session with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un in Singapore in June. The two men later signed a vaguely worded document in which the North Korean leader affirmed his commitment to the “complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” But what does that mean? North Korea has begun dismantling key facilities at an airport rocket launching site, suggesting that it is complying with its pledge to Trump in Singapore, a U.S. monitor reported Monday. Yet other signals coming from North Korea have raised questions about the country’s commitment to denuclearization. In July, when Pompeo went to North Korea for a follow-up meeting, North Korean leaders called the confab “regrettable” and accused Pompeo of making “gangster-like” demands to give up the country’s nuclear weapons. Senators want answers on where the denuclearization talks are heading. “It’s nice to see some small real action by North Korea, but frankly so far the actual consequences of the handshake photo-op summit in Singapore have been preciously few,” Coons said. Coons said it’s admirable that Pompeo remains upbeat and positive about what can come out of the agreement, “but there’s many more things that North Korea can and should be doing to lay out a timeline towards verifiable, irreversible denuclearization.” Will there be an Iran summit? Senators are expected to have lots of questions about the administration’s policy on Iran following Trump’s Twitter tirade against that country late Sunday night. \"NEVER EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKE OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE,\" Trump wrote in all-capital letters. The White House said Trump was responding to a threat by Iran President Hassan Rouhani, who earlier in the day warned that America must recognize that “war with Iran is the mother of all wars.” On Tuesday, just a day and a half after his tweet, Trump shifted his tone. He told a veterans’ group in Kansas City that his administration is ready to talk about a new nuclear deal with Tehran, prompting speculation that his bellicose rhetoric might be a tactic to get Iran back to the negotiating table. The United States and other world powers signed a deal with Iran in 2015 that was designed to keep Iran from developing nuclear weapons. But Trump pulled out of the agreement in May, calling the pact signed by the administration of then-President Barack Obama “a horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made.” Senators are looking to Pompeo to provide clarity on the Trump administration’s Iran policy. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., told reporters that Trump needs to consult with his foreign policy team and come up with a strategy for dealing with Iran, “as opposed to tweets that aggravate the situation.” What's with the attacks on U.S. allies? Before Trump’s make-nice meeting with Putin, he berated, embarrassed, and provoked several important U.S. allies. He accused Germany of being “captive to Russia” because of that country’s support for a pipeline that would bring Russian natural gas through the Baltic Sea to central Europe. He criticized British Prime Minister Theresa May over her handling of Brexit, the withdrawal of England from the European Union, and voiced support for her rival, Boris Johnson. And he lambasted NATO allies over what he said was their inadequate spending on defense, even privately threatening to abandon the alliance. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY) Sen. Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican who chairs of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, seemed exasperated by Trump's attacks on American allies and what he called “the continual undermining of Americans’ view of NATO, purposefully.\" \"... Toward what end?” Corker said Tuesday when asked what he would focus on during the Pompeo hearing. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., echoed that frustration. “I want to know what he’s going to do to repair the damage that’s been done to the transatlantic alliance,” Murphy said. “Some of it is irreparable but we have to have an action plan.” Trump's aggressive trade policy Republicans have long been squeamish about the president’s attacks on free trade, a central GOP plank before Trump became the party’s standard bearer. They didn’t like his decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. They’re nervous about his efforts to re-negotiate NAFTA. And many of them dislike his tariffs, slapped on foreign competitors in an effort to gain leverage and strike better trade agreements. That discomfort ratcheted up on Tuesday, when Trump announced $12 billion in federal aid to farmers who have been hurt by retaliatory tariffs levied by China and other countries. Several lawmakers said that's an expensive fix for a problem Trump created. “Our farmers have been in nonstop saying they want trade, not aid,” said Corker. He said Trump’s tariff policies have put farmers “in the poorhouse” and now his solution is to put them on welfare. \"What a terrible policy,\" Corker said, adding there is no money to pay for it. There are several farm-state senators on the Foreign Relations Committee who want to know how far the Trump Administration plans to go with this trade war. Other lawmakers have expressed concerns about whether other economic sectors, such as energy and auto industries, will also get federal help for retaliatory tariffs that hurt their bottom lines.

{"global_context": "A former top aide to Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan broke his silence Wednesday about sexual harassment allegations against him, echoing a legal defense already laid by the speaker’s camp and attacking the political worker who made the charges. Ex-Madigan lieutenant Kevin Quinn, who was fired in February as Democratic foot soldier Alaina Hampton was about to go public, downplayed suggestions that the speaker’s political army retaliated against her after she complained about unwanted advances as well as aggressive text messages and phone calls from Quinn. In a 14-page annotated statement he dubbed “The Truth,” Quinn acknowledged his behavior was inappropriate but said it did not rise to the legal level of workplace harassment. Quinn also portrayed Hampton as an unreliable employee who was on bad terms with the speaker’s political organization after twice leaving jobs connected to Madigan. The final straw, Quinn said, was when Hampton went to work on Marie Newman’s congressional campaign last year even though Madigan backed U.S. Rep. Dan Lipinski. “Alaina wanted to be a member of the Organization on her own terms. She was never retaliated against in any way,” Quinn wrote. “She was treated the same as any other volunteer would have been treated that quit both speaker’s government staff in 2014 and the 13th Ward Democratic Organization in 2016 by not being welcomed back for additional political assignments.” Hampton is suing the state Democratic Party and three Madigan-controlled campaign funds. She maintains she attempted to work for a House Democratic campaign this year but was rebuffed, a move that she said stymied her career. On Wednesday, Hampton deferred comment to her lawyer, who was in court for a routine hearing on the lawsuit. Attorney Shelly Kulwin said he couldn’t respond in detail because there is information his side doesn’t have, such as possible communications with Madigan. “What was happening that we haven’t seen yet?” Kulwin said. “I’ll respond to ‘the truth’ once I know.” Quinn’s statement, however, drew sharp criticism from Democratic Rep. Kelly Cassidy of Chicago, who has been a vocal critic of Madigan’s handling of sexual harassment allegations. She said Quinn’s memo could deter other women from coming forward with sexual harassment complaints. “This is just another offensive tactic from the old playbook that aims to discredit and undermine women who come forward,” Cassidy said. “Women considering speaking out should not let Mr. Quinn’s despicable behavior deter them.” Quinn’s statement — in which he often refers to himself in the third person — includes several partial transcripts of news conference quotes involving Hampton, a timeline and an appendix. Much of the document is devoted to absolving Madigan and Quinn’s brother, 13th Ward Ald. Marty Quinn. Alaina Hampton formerly worked on political campaigns for the Democratic organization run by Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan. Hampton says her supervisor, Kevin Quinn, sexually harassed her for several months beginning in fall 2016. (Stacey Wescott / Chicago Tribune) Alaina Hampton formerly worked on political campaigns for the Democratic organization run by Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan. Hampton says her supervisor, Kevin Quinn, sexually harassed her for several months beginning in fall 2016. (Stacey Wescott / Chicago Tribune) SEE MORE VIDEOS Kevin Quinn, who has been unemployed since February, told the Tribune on Wednesday that he spent “a long time” working on the statement and did not share it with Madigan’s camp before sending it to reporters. Madigan spokesman Steve Brown said that “to our knowledge, no one within the speaker’s government or political offices had any involvement with Kevin Quinn in preparing this document.” The former political worker’s memo put the sexual harassment story back in the spotlight a week after Madigan ousted his longtime chief of staff following sexual harassment and bullying allegations from a House staff member against the speaker’s top aide. Tim Mapes’ departure marked the fourth time in four months that Madigan quickly distanced himself from a key operative after public allegations of improper behavior. As the #MeToo movement continues to have repercussions at the Illinois Capitol, some Democratic women lawmakers have suggested that Madigan has failed to act aggressively enough to address complaints of harassment lodged against the well-connected men within his political organization. Earlier this week, Madigan announced that he would hire a human resources director as well as an equal employment opportunity and affirmative action officer for the House Democrats. On Feb. 12, as Hampton prepared to take legal action, Madigan issued a news release stating that Kevin Quinn had been forced out of the political organization, calling Hampton “courageous” and acknowledging Quinn’s inappropriate behavior. The release also came less than 24 hours after Hampton met with a Tribune reporter and provided explicit texts that Quinn sent her, including one in which he referenced a Facebook picture of Hampton in a bikini and called her “smoking hot.” Hampton repeatedly discouraged the overtures, saying she wanted to keep the relationship professional. Both sides agree the unwanted contact stopped after Ald. Quinn reprimanded his brother. Quinn attempted to dissect several of those text messages in his statement, using select phrases from them to prove he wasn’t Hampton’s supervisor — a key defense offered by Madigan’s attorneys in the wake of the scandal. Hampton’s direct supervisor was Ald. Quinn, the memo contends. “I was never Ms. Hampton’s supervisor and never had any control over her assignments. My role was to simply facilitate communication between Alderman Marty Quinn, managers of targeted campaigns, and volunteers of the 13th Ward Democratic Organization,” he said.

Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, whose country is taking part in air strikes against rebel-held areas in the southwest, told reporters after the session that there was no press statement \"because they are focusing on cessation of hostilities and we are focusing on fighting terrorists.\" The escalation in Daraa, one of Syria's last major rebel strongholds near Jordan and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, began on June 19 and has forced an estimated 330,000 people to flee their homes. Opposition activists say scores of civilians have been killed. Nebenzia said Russia agrees with other council members on the need for humanitarian access, but questioned how many civilians are in need of assistance. Sweden's U.N. Ambassador Olof Skoog, the current council president, had called the emergency consultations with Kuwait, the Arab representative on the council, hoping to get the 15 members to agree on a statement calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities and unrestricted access to deliver humanitarian aid. Skoog said all members expressed concern about the humanitarian situation and \"a broad majority of countries\" believe it's urgent to implement a resolution adopted in February that calls for a cease-fire and humanitarian access. \"I think what may differ a little bit is the emphasis right now among some members who are heavily involved on the ground,\" he told reporters after the meeting. Skoog said he definitely expects the council to follow up and possibly hold an open meeting on what he called the \"very dramatic and deteriorating situation.\" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Secretary-General Antonio Guterres \"is gravely concerned by the resumption of the military offensive in southwest Syria and its continued devastating impact on civilians.\" Guterres again appeals for \"an immediate suspension of the hostilities and the resumption of negotiations,\" stressing that \"an estimated 750,000 lives are in danger,\" Dujarric said.

{"global_context": "West Virginia lawmakers impeached all four state Supreme Court justices over extravagant spending. But some Democrats are crying foul. Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. Allen Loughry, a justice on the West Virginia state Supreme Court, literally wrote the book on political corruption. \"Don't Buy Another Vote, I Won't Pay for a Landslide,\" published 12 years ago, takes aim at the \"sordid\" culture of grift and graft in his home state. But this week, in an ironic coda to his 623-page tome, Loughry found himself at the center of a roiling political scandal. He and his three other colleagues on the highest court in West Virginia were impeached over financial abuses and extravagant spending — such as the $363,000 that Loughry, who faces a 23-count federal indictment, dropped on renovations for his office. The way the justices seemed to burn through cash was, in the eyes of many outraged legislators, a clear abuse of power — not to mention a bad look in a poor and cash-strapped state where 17.9 percent of the population lives in poverty. The 11 articles of impeachment passed the state House late Monday, setting the stage for a trial in the state Senate. But as the dust settled on Tuesday, some Democratic lawmakers and a few legal experts cried foul. Yes, some of them said, the profligate spending was unacceptable — even deeply offensive. But impeachment, they said, might have been a mite extreme, especially for the justices accused of less egregious financial infractions. In the words of one legislator, the whole affair \"reeks of partisan politics\" and resembles a purge. \"It was absolutely, in my opinion, a partisan witch hunt,\" said that legislator, Mike Caputo, the Democratic minority whip in the state House of Delegates. Republicans control both chambers of the legislature — including 22 out of 34 seats in the state Senate, where a two-thirds vote is required for conviction. The state's GOP governor, Jim Justice, would then fill as many as three vacancies on the bench. (Justice's office did not immediately return a request for comment.) \"That would mean you have one party controlling the House, one party controlling the Senate, one party controlling the governorship, and that same party controlling the judiciary,\" said Chad Lovejoy, another Democrat in the state House. \"We're talking about taking off the head of another co-equal branch.\" At least one of the impeached justices seemed to recognize the political stakes. Justice Robin Davis, a Democrat who was impeached for spending some $500,000 in office renovations, resigned on Tuesday morning right before a deadline to set a November special election to fill empty seats on the five-member court. \"When a legislative body attempts to dismantle a separate branch of government, the immediate effects as well as the precedent it sets for the future can only be deemed disastrous,\" Davis said in prepared remarks at the state Capitol on Tuesday. \"The will of the people of West Virginia is being denied.\" Davis' seat, along with that of a fifth justice, Menis Ketchum, who resigned in July, will be decided at the ballot box. But if Loughry and the two other impeached justices — Margaret Workman, a Democrat, and Beth Walker, a Republican — are convicted in the state Senate and removed from office, Gov. Justice would get to handpick their temporary replacements, who would eventually come up for election. It was absolutely, in my opinion, a partisan witch hunt.\" It appeared no legislators from either party have defended the justices for their apparently lavish spending habits. Rodney Miller, a Democrat in the state House, said he was \"offended\" by the expenditures and other financial abuses, such as Loughry taking home a $32,000 suede leather couch. Caputo, the legislator who blasted the purported \"witch hunt,\" said he thought some of it was \"horrible and quite frankly disgusting.\" John Shott, a Republican who oversaw the state House Judiciary Committee hearings that produced the articles of impeachment, has said the high court spent more than $3 million in office renovations earlier this decade as the state was barely staying afloat financially and grappling with painful budget cuts, according to the Associated Press. But in West Virginia, unlike most U.S. states, the judiciary effectively controls its own budget, giving the justices wide latitude, said Patricia Proctor, the director of the Simon Perry Center for Constitutional Democracy at Marshall University in West Virginia. In other words, as \"outrageous as some of the spending was, the [state] Constitution gives the justices the authority to do this,\" said Caputo, the legislator — \"even Justice Loughry, who is up to his neck in the swamp he's with the alligators.\" (Loughry was suspended from the bench earlier this year. He has pleaded not guilty to 23 charges in a federal corruption indictment.) A date has not been announced for the trial of Loughry as well as Workman and Walker, both of whom announced on Tuesday that they would not step down from the court. In the meantime, the top court in the state finds itself in limbo, said James Sample, a law professor at Hofstra University who specializes in judicial ethics. \"Whatever the interim period is, we essentially don't have a functioning West Virginia state Supreme Court,\" Sample said.

{"global_context": "The Wisconsin Legislature's Republican-controlled budget committee voted Tuesday to stand by its decision to reject Gov. Tony Evers' plan to expand Medicaid, turning down more than $1 billion in federal funding and $324 million in state money savings. Democrats accused Republicans of being fiscally irresponsible for not taking the Medicaid expansion and for reducing what the governor wanted to spend in a variety of areas including community health programs, dental health initiatives for poor people, crisis intervention services and lead poisoning prevention efforts. \"There is no moral high ground in your choice,\" said Democratic state Rep. Chris Taylor, of Madison. \"There is no moral high ground in turning your back on people whose lives you could have saved.\" The Joint Finance Committee is working to revise Evers' two-year state budget before voting, perhaps as soon as next week, to send it to the full Legislature. Evers can then sign the budget as passed, use his broad partial veto powers to make changes, or reject the entire $83 billion spending plan. Republicans defended not expanding Medicaid, saying they didn't want to add a projected 82,000 more people who earn between poverty level and 38% above it to the state's BadgerCare Medicaid program. It makes more sense, Republicans argue, to keep them in the private insurance market where they can qualify for highly subsidized plans sold through the marketplace created under the Affordable Care Act. Expanding Medicaid wasn't necessary because the state's economy is strong with plenty of available jobs, said Rep. John Nygren, co-chair of the budget committee. \"Yes, we said no to Medicaid expansion — guilty,\" Nygren said. \"But we can also take a strong stand with pride that our state is headed in the right direction.\" Republican Sen. Alberta Darling, the other co-chair, said the committee was investing in people, not programs. \"We're not expanding welfare, that was the big concern,\" she said. The additional state funding Republicans approved included a $77 million increase for the Wisconsin Shares program that provides money to working parents for child care, $30 million more for nursing homes, an additional $37 million for personal care workers and $27 million more for direct caregivers in the Family Care program. Nygren said those increases, some of which go beyond what Evers proposed, were responsive to what people around the state wanted. \"The governor's proposal was lacking, we exceeded it,\" Nygren said. The committee voted to cut state payments to Milwaukee County for child welfare services by $14 million, a move that Democratic state Rep. Evan Goyke called a \"screwing\" for the city he represents. Republicans also rejected Evers' proposal to repeal drug screening and work requirements for recipients of the state's FoodShare food stamp program. In total, Republicans voted to spend about $611 million more in state money over two years on the Health Services and Children and Family Services departments. Evers took his victory over longtime Medicaid expansion opponent, former Gov. Scott Walker, as a sign that voters wanted to join the majority of other states in accepting the federal money. But Republicans made it one of the first items removed from his budget proposal. Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos has been particularly steadfast against, saying last month that Medicaid will be expanded \"over our dead bodies.\" Evers has been undeterred, vowing to \"fight like hell\" to save his proposal, pointing to public opinion polls showing support as high as 70%. To date, Wisconsin has missed out on $1.1 billion in federal money for Medicaid expansion. It is one of only 14 states that have not accepted Medicaid expansion money and the only one that did a partial expansion to cover people up to 100% of poverty without taking the money. The Evers plan that Republicans rejected would have increased the Medicaid-eligible income level from 100% of poverty to 138%. That would raise eligible annual income from $25,750 for a family of four to $35,535. For a single person, the income cutoff would go from $12,490 to $17,236. About half of the 82,000 people expected to qualify for Medicaid already have insurance now through subsidized plans sold through the marketplace. The other half do not have insurance.

Backed by Bernie: Backed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and a coalition of progressive groups, Gillum upset former Rep. Gwen Graham who led in the polls for most of the campaign. He outlasted a field of five competitive candidates, in which he was the only non-millionaire — and only supporter of \"Medicare for all\" single-payer health care.

Nikki Haley will hold a reception for the ambassadors of countries who did not support a U.N. General Assembly vote condemning the U.S. for its recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. The invitation to the Jan. 3 reception, a copy of which was obtained by Breitbart News, was sent to the 65 countries who either rejected, abstained from, or declined to vote on the resolution that censured the U.S. for President Trump’s decision to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. “The Honorable Nikki R. Haley … invites you to a reception to thank you for your friendship to the United States,” the invite for the Jan. 3 reception says. The nonbinding resolution, which passed 128-9, expressed “deep regret” at the call made by President Trump, and calls on “all States to refrain from the establishment of diplomatic missions in the Holy City of Jerusalem.” 35 countries abstained and 21 countries did not turn up to vote. The resolution was sponsored by Turkey and Yemen and came days after the U.S. vetoed a similar resolution at the Security Council. Haley took to the General Assembly floor to blast the U.N. over the vote and to warn countries that the vote “will be remembered.” “We will remember it when we are called upon to once again make the world’s largest contribution to the United Nations and we will remember it when so many countries come calling on us, as they so often do, to pay even more and to use our influence for their benefit,” she warned. President Trump on Wednesday warned that the U.S intended to pull money from “nations that take our money and vote against us.” “They take hundreds of millions of dollars and even billions of dollars then vote against us, well we’re watching those votes,” he said. “Let them vote against us; we’ll save a lot. We don’t care.” The reception will likely be seen as symbolic of the Trump administration’s intent to keep note of who is and who is not supporting the U.S. agenda at the U.N. The aggressive stance over the resolution by the U.S., particularly the funding threat, sparked anger from some diplomats. “We were all asked to vote “no” or face the consequences. Some were even threatened with [a] development aid cut. Such an attitude is unacceptable,” Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu said during the debate on Thursday. “This is bullying and this chamber will not vote to do that.” Adam Shaw is a Breitbart News politics reporter based in New York.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Brexit protesters chant 'Nazi and scum' at Conservative MP Anna Soubry More than 50 MPs have called on the head of Britain's largest police force to improve their response to abusive protesters outside Parliament. Writing to Met Police commissioner Cressida Dick, the MPs cited \"serious concerns\" about the \"deteriorating public order and security situation\". It comes after Conservative MP Anna Soubry was verbally abused on Monday. She was shouted at - including being called a liar and a Nazi - during live TV interviews on BBC News and Sky. The former minister was later shouted at, called \"scum\" and jostled as she tried to re-enter the Palace of Westminster. Ms Soubry later criticised police for not intervening and called for the protesters to be prosecuted under public order laws. The Met said it is investigating whether any crimes were committed, after having received a third-party report of a public order offence on College Green. College Green - the area opposite Parliament - is regularly used by media to interview politicians, as well as being a popular site for protesters to gather. 'Far right and extreme right' Labour MP Stephen Doughty coordinated the letter to Met Police chief Ms Dick, which has been signed by at least 55 MPs. The cross-party group of MPs - which includes those both for and against Brexit - said many of the concerns had been \"repeatedly raised\" with officers and senior policing staff. \"We write to express our serious concerns about the deteriorating public order and security situation in and around the exterior of the Parliamentary estate including College Green,\" the letter read. Image copyright PA Met Police commissioner Cressida Dick took up the job in 2017 \"After months of peaceful and calm protests by groups representing a range of political views on Brexit, an ugly element of individuals with strong far right and extreme right connections - which your officers are well aware of - have increasingly engaged in intimidatory and potentially criminal acts targeting Members of Parliament, journalists, activists and members of the public. \"We understand there are ongoing investigations but there appears to be an ongoing lack of coordination in the response from the police and appropriate authorities including with Westminster borough policing - and despite clear assurances this would be dealt with following incidents before Christmas - there have been a number of further serious and well publicised incidents today.\" The letter adds that it is \"utterly unacceptable for Members of Parliament, journalists, activists and members of the public to be subject to abuse, intimidation and threatening behaviour and indeed potentially serious offences while they go about their work\".

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Anna Soubry: \"This is astonishing. This is what has happened to our country.\" Ms Soubry, pro-European MP for Broxtowe and who supports another Brexit referendum, said she objected to being called a Nazi. Labour's Mary Creagh said the \"really vile, misogynistic thuggery\" that had been seen was not an isolated incident. She pointed to the murder of MP Jo Cox, who was killed in her West Yorkshire constituency by right-wing extremist Thomas Mair in June 2016. And Commons Speaker John Bercow said he was \"concerned\" about a \"pattern of protest\" targeting female MPs and journalists. Criticism came from different parties and all sides of the Brexit debate - including from high-profile Brexit supporters such as Piers Morgan who called it \"disgusting\". Also on Monday, political commentator Owen Jones published a video to Twitter that he had recorded while being followed and shouted at by a group of protesters outside Parliament. 'Unacceptable' Ms Soubry has been in touch with the parliamentary authorities responsible for security. Mr Bercow said he was aware of protests in recent weeks around the Palace of Westminster \"involving aggressive and threatening behaviour towards members by assorted groups that have donned the yellow vests seen in France\" - a reference to last year's \"gilet jaune\" anti-government demonstrations. While the Met had responsibility for security outside the parliamentary estate, he said, he was keeping a \"close eye\" on the issue amid concerns that women, in particular, were being targeted. \"I share 100% the concerns expressed and it's necessary to state very publicly the difference between peaceful protest on one hand and the aggressive, intimidatory and threatening protest on the other.\" No 10 said the incident was \"unacceptable\" and MPs \"should be free to do their jobs without any form of intimidation\". A Downing Street spokesman said there were laws dealing with public order offences and cases of harassment and threatening behaviour. The BBC and other broadcasters have set up temporary studios on College Green ahead of the big Commons vote on Theresa May's Brexit deal on 15 January.

A Syrian man who is a refugee was arrested Wednesday on terrorism charges in connection with a plan to attack a church in Pittsburgh, according to authorities. Mustafa Mousab Alowemer, 21, was arrested based on a federal complaint charging him with one count of attempting to provide material support and resources to the self-described Islamic State, also known as ISIS, according to the U.S. Justice Department. He’s also charged with two counts of distributing information relating to an explosive, destructive device or weapon of mass destruction in relation to a plan to attack the Legacy International Worship Center on the city’s north side. The complaint states that Alowemer in May gave “multiple instructional documents” detailing how to build and use explosives, including improvised explosive devices, to an undercover FBI agent he believed was an ISIS supporter. Federal prosecutors allege that the man handed over these documents intending for them to be used in assembling a weapon to conduct an attack. Alowemer allegedly bought several items earlier this month that could be used to build explosives, according to the complaint. Those alleged items include nails, batteries and consumer products that contain chemicals. Page 20 of the complaint details a June 11 meeting between Alowemer and an undercover FBI employee, where the agent seemed to have to guide the suspect on how to make a bomb in the first place. Alowemer reportedly communicated with an undercover agent he believed to be a supporter of ISIS while planning the attack, stating his own support for the terror group and desire to be involved in the reported attack, according to the complaint.

{"global_context": "Puerto Ricans have long felt like second-class U.S. citizens. The island lacks voting representation in Congress or any power in presidential elections. Nearly everything costs more, including healthcare. And now, amid the devastation of Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico has another reminder of its status as a non-state: the slow arrival of federal assistance. President Trump’s explanation for the difficulty of providing aid only reinforced its sense of isolation. “This is an island, surrounded by water,” he said. “Big water. Ocean water.” With Trump scheduled to visit here Tuesday, the response to the disaster has revived a long-standing debate over the territory’s relationship to the rest of the United States and what could be done to address the inequalities. “It is certainly the responsibility of all U.S. citizens to ask themselves if we believe in democracy, if we believe in rights and equality which are the pillars of our society, how can we still have a colonial territory with more than 3 million citizens that don’t have access to the same rights and the same political power?” Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello told reporters Monday. “Military veterans gave the same sacrifices to the nation they love, but they don’t get the same benefits just because they live over here,” he said. Rossello — who said he plans to raise such questions of fairness with Trump on Tuesday — and his New Progressive Party argue that the first step to righting the wrongs is to make the island a state. A significant number of Puerto Ricans appear to agree with him, based on five referendums held on the issue since 1967. The most recent, in June, offered voters three options: the current territorial status, statehood or independence in free association with the U.S. Statehood won with 97% of the vote. But turnout was historically low at 23%, in part because of a boycott by the Popular Democratic Party, which favors the status quo. Celso Melendez, 25, and his dog Popeye live in Old San Juan, where Melendez works as a bartender and studies chemical engineering. He feels it will be even harder for Puerto Rico to get statehood after the hurricane with all of the debt the island has taken on. Celso Melendez, 25, and his dog Popeye live in Old San Juan, where Melendez works as a bartender and studies chemical engineering. He feels it will be even harder for Puerto Rico to get statehood after the hurricane with all of the debt the island has taken on. Ultimately, Puerto Rico has little say in whether it becomes a state. That power rests with Congress — both the House and Senate would have to approve it — and the president, who would have to sign off on it. The last states to be added were Hawaii and Alaska in 1959. The U.S. seized Puerto Rico in the Spanish-American War in 1898 and granted its people citizenship in 1917. They pay federal taxes, but the resident commissioner who represents them in Congress has no vote, and their votes in presidential elections are largely symbolic, since the island has no electoral votes. The island’s deep economic crisis was already fueling new calls for statehood when Hurricane Maria hit last month. Its devastation has given new life to the campaign. Jose Fuentes, chairman of the Washington-based Puerto Rico Statehood Council, said now is the time for Congress to put Puerto Rico “on the road to statehood” by bringing its tax, education and healthcare reimbursements in line with the mainland. “The destruction in Puerto Rico gave the U.S. a chance to do the right thing and rebuild the territory as a state,” he said. “This is the time. Are we going to invest that money to rebuild Puerto Rico and be in the same position when another storm hits?” The push for statehood has mixed support among members of Congress with Puerto Rican roots, advocates and political leaders on the island. Two of the island’s main political parties support either independence or a version of the current commonwealth status. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, who has traded barbs with Trump in recent days over delayed federal hurricane aid, said Monday that statehood won’t turn Puerto Rico into “Disneyland.” A member of the Popular Democratic Party, she noted that deep disparities in wealth, education and other economic-social indicators exist between U.S. states. “I’m an advocate of a different relationship with the U.S. that allows us more power, more sovereignty, and that recognizes Puerto Rico as a Caribbean nation,” she said outside the city’s emergency operations center in Roberto Clemente Coliseum. “In the next few months we have to talk about what that relationship should be.” San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, who has traded barbs with President Trump over delayed federal hurricane aid, said Monday that statehood won’t turn Puerto Rico into “Disneyland.” San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, who has traded barbs with President Trump over delayed federal hurricane aid, said Monday that statehood won’t turn Puerto Rico into “Disneyland.” SEE MORE VIDEOS She and other Puerto Rican mayors joined a conference call Monday with Trump’s Homeland Security advisor Tom Bossert and other administration officials, who she said “let us know the White House is very committed to making things work, that we’ve had some challenges but with the help of the mayors they hope things will go faster.” Looming over the question of Puerto Rico’s status is the exodus of Puerto Ricans to the U.S. mainland, a process that was already being driven by economic hardship but seems poised to accelerate in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, especially as shortages of power, gasoline, food and water persist. “We don’t know if these folks are overwhelmingly pro-statehood, or pro-commonwealth…. We have no idea who’s leaving the island,” said Amilcar Barreto, an associate professor of political science, international affairs and public policy at Northeastern University. For many Puerto Ricans, he said, “The status issue is about your identity: Do you identify as American? More Puerto Rican than American? That’s the nature of status politics. It’s like a marriage with all the emotional attachments.” As Rossello pointed out, any Puerto Rican can simply move to the U.S. mainland and be guaranteed the full rights of all citizens. On the streets of San Juan on Monday, it wasn’t hard to find support for statehood. “I was born in New York. Now I live in Puerto Rico. I don’t have the same rights I had there?” said Peter Carasquillo, 50, a film writer and director who voted for statehood in the last referendum. “They should have taken up this issue a long time ago.” He had lost his home in the hurricane and was waiting in a line for help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. He hoped to stay on the island and rebuild. Sitting nearby, Odalys Baez agreed. “We are American,” said Baez, 34. “I lived in Miami for six months and there’s so much more help there: More medical help, education for children, opportunities to better yourself, to set up businesses.” She and her father, a Pentecostal pastor 20 miles south in Naranjito, had come for help repairing their church, which lost its roof in the hurricane.

Unofficial results broadcast by local media suggest that ex-football star George Weah is ahead of Vice-President Joseph Boakai following Tuesday's vote. The electoral commission has warned against \"premature pronouncements\". Armed police have been deployed around its headquarters in the capital, Monrovia, ahead of the release of official results. However, the mood in Monrovia is calm, and people are eagerly awaiting the results, reports the BBC's Jonathan Paye-Layleh from the city. \"The Liberian people clearly made their choice... and all together we are very confident in the result of the electoral process,\" Mr Weah said on Wednesday. His supporters had planned a victory parade, but dropped the idea after foreign observers urged them to wait for the official results, our correspondent says. Mr Boakai said it was premature for Mr Weah's supporters to celebrate, AFP news agency reports. \"We are waiting for the final results. People are talking about Weah, but it's only in his counties but not mine,\" it quoted him as saying. Mr Weah, 51, won the first round in October with 38.4% of the vote, compared with the 28.8% of Mr Boakai, 73.

{"global_context": "Judges will probably decide how much deference to give presidential power and what, if any, evidence Trump needs to support his claims. A border wall in San Diego. Lawsuits allege that President Trump’s emergency declaration is unconstitutional, but experts say he might not need to provide evidence of an emergency. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post) The legal battle over President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency to pay for a border wall grew Tuesday with another lawsuit challenging his actions, a fight that could explore sweeping constitutional questions as judges decide how much deference to give presidential power and what — if any — evidence Trump needs to support his claims of a dire situation needing a solution that sidesteps Congress. The lawsuits challenging Trump’s order argue that there is no evidence of an emergency at the southern border, assail his action as unconstitutional and accuse him of manufacturing a crisis. Trump said that only a border wall could prevent “an invasion of our country with drugs, with human traffickers, with all types of criminals and gangs.” But the National Emergencies Act, which Trump cited in his declaration, does not specifically say what constitutes an emergency, said Stephen I. Vladeck, a University of Texas law professor and constitutional law expert. And while courts tend to defer to government officials who invoke national security issues, the fight over Trump’s emergency decree — which the president said was needed to fund his long-promised wall — marks a new frontier for an administration that has been willing to take action and let the courts sort it out. “We’ve really never had litigation under the National Emergencies Act before, so to some degree we’re in uncharted territory,” Vladeck said. Vladeck said that rather than seeking specific evidence of an emergency or trying to second-guess whether the border situation is an emergency, he expects the courts to look at “the meaning of hitherto obscure statutes.” Such an examination could hinge on whether Trump has authority to carry out narrow, specific actions, such as the president’s move to divert $3.6 billion in previously appropriated military construction funds for the construction, experts said. “The president himself has admitted that this is not a national emergency, that there is no real crisis,” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said Tuesday. (Mason Trinca/For The Washington Post) The American Civil Liberties Union on Tuesday joined the fray, filing a lawsuit on behalf of the Sierra Club and the Southern Border Communities Coalition against the emergency declaration. That came a day after a coalition of 16 states filed suit. [Coalition of states challenges Trump’s declaration] While Trump has characterized the situation at the border as a crisis, advocates have described a different struggle there, with many of the people seeking entry to the United States arriving essentially as refugees, fleeing violence and hunger in Central America. Some are being forced to wait in dangerous places in Mexico while their asylum claims are processed. “We know firsthand there is no national emergency at the border, only the one that exists in Trump’s mind,” Vicki Gaubeca, director of the Southern Border Communities Coalition, told reporters Tuesday. “The southern border is a place of hope and opportunity, not a place of hate . . . Trump is manufacturing a crisis in one of the safest, most vibrant places in our nation to fulfill a campaign promise based on ignorance, hate and fear.” [Trump’s border emergency drags GOP into risky fight ahead of 2020] Dror Ladin, a staff lawyer with the ACLU’s National Security Project, described the legal challenge to the emergency as needed because Trump is ignoring Congress’s decisions about how to spend taxpayer money. “The founders were very worried about letting an executive freely spend on whatever projects he decided in his own judgment were important, when the will of the people were against it,” Ladin said. John Yoo, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley and a Justice Department lawyer during the administration of President George W. Bush, said that while he’s “not a big fan of Trump or his immigration policies,” he thinks “the Supreme Court will uphold the emergency declaration.” Yoo said he believes that the administration will cite “the only relevant” Supreme Court precedent, a challenge in 1981 to President Jimmy Carter’s use of emergency power to block Iranian assets in the wake of the Iran hostage crisis. In an 8-to-1 ruling, the court upheld Carter’s action. The court “never asked if the Iranian hostage crisis was a real emergency,” said Yoo, who during his time in government wrote memos asserting dramatic White House power. “You can’t define an emergency beforehand. That’s why it’s an emergency. The moment you say, ‘An emergency has these three or four characteristics,’ you’re defeating the purpose” of the laws authorizing emergency actions. Vladeck said the litigation playing out in court will ultimately be “a lot more specific and I think a lot more nuanced” than many initial responses. “It’s not surprising that the president’s critics are portraying his actions in that manner, but courts for a whole host of reasons are going to, where possible, decide these cases on more technical grounds,” he said. “I think it’s quite possible that we’re heading toward a rash of lawsuits that have at their core the perceived illegitimacy of this emergency but that actually turn on very different questions about the appropriate uses of repurposed military construction funds.” Trump knew beforehand that his emergency declaration would face legal hurdles, and during his announcement of the declaration Friday in the Rose Garden, he laid out his view of how the lawsuits might unfold. “We will have a national emergency, and we will then be sued, and they will sue us in the 9th Circuit, even though it shouldn’t be there, and we will possibly get a bad ruling, and then we’ll get another bad ruling, and then we’ll end up in the Supreme Court, and hopefully we’ll get a fair shake and we’ll win in the Supreme Court,” Trump said. The ACLU lawsuit, like the complaint filed by the coalition of states, was entered in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California; the group said this was because the Sierra Club’s headquarters are located in Oakland. [How President Trump came to declare an emergency] In their lawsuit, the coalition of states — most of which are not located along the southern border — included explanations of their respective standing for challenging the declaration in court. Some said it could strip them of funding for National Guard troops, drug interdiction and military construction projects. Other opponents of Trump’s declaration that did not join the lawsuit are trying to determine if they can do so. Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey called Trump’s action an “illegal power grab” but said her staff is researching whether it would directly affect their state. Washington state is taking a similar approach. Other states on the border showed no signs of joining up. In a statement, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a Republican, defended Trump’s “broad authority to declare a national emergency with existing powers” Congress has given him. “Congress has failed to act on the long-standing crisis at our southern border, and the president should be doing everything he legally can to improve border security,” he said. The outcome of the challenges to Trump’s order could ultimately depend on how much deference courts are willing to give him as a president arguing there is a national security issue, said Bobby Chesney, a constitutional law professor at the University of Texas. None of the laws Trump has invoked have specific definitions for emergencies, Chesney said. “In any normal situation, that would be the end of the matter,” he said, meaning that, absent a clear definition, the president would be given wide latitude to come up with his own definition of an emergency. But Trump’s comments could complicate matters, because he “keeps saying things that suggest there’s not an emergency in any layman’s sense of the term,” Chesney said. During his announcement Friday, Trump described the declaration as needed for speed rather than urgency, telling reporters: “I could do the wall over a longer period of time. I didn’t need to do this, but I’d rather do it much faster.” Those comments appeared in the lawsuit filed Monday by California, New York and 14 other states assailing Trump’s order as an “unconstitutional and unlawful scheme” that they said would lead to environmental damage in some states and economic damage in others. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said Tuesday that Trump’s actions already have undermined his case. “The president himself has admitted that this is not a national emergency, that there is no real crisis,” Becerra, a Democrat, said in an interview Tuesday. “He himself said he didn’t need to do this declaration.” Stephen Miller, a senior White House policy adviser, sought to reframe Trump’s remarks about the timetable in an interview over the weekend. “What the president was saying is that like past presidents, he could choose to ignore this crisis, choose to ignore this emergency as others have,” Miller said on “Fox News Sunday.” “But that’s not what he’s going to do.” Trump’s claims about the situation at the border are at odds with the facts on the ground, something he dismissed last week by belittling government statistics. Advocates for migrants have argued that the suggestion of an emergency at the border is focusing on the wrong front. “It’s a historically low number of people crossing,” said Erika Andiola, chief of advocacy for Raices, a Texas nonprofit that is aiding immigrants. “They’re knocking at the door, and there’s not enough help or support from the U.S. government to actually process them.” In their lawsuit, states say the border is more difficult to cross than ever. Apprehensions are near 45-year lows, down from more than 1.6 million arrests in fiscal 2000 to slightly fewer than 400,000 last year; the number of agents patrolling the U.S.-Mexico border nearly doubled during that period.

By Allan Smith President Donald Trump said acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker is \"right\" about his criticism of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation and defended his appointment of Whitaker after forcing out Attorney General Jeff Sessions earlier this month. During an interview with Chris Wallace on \"Fox News Sunday,\" Trump also seemed to shut down the idea of soon sitting with Mueller for an interview, among multiple other subjects. On Whitaker, Trump said he \"did not know he took views on the Mueller investigation,\" adding that those views didn't have \"any effect\" on the appointment. But, Trump said his views on the probe are \"right.\" \"What do you do when a person’s right?\" Trump said. \"There is no collusion. He happened to be right. I mean, he said it. So if he said there is collusion, I’m supposed to be taking somebody that says there is? Because then I wouldn’t take him for two reasons, but the number one reason is the fact that he would have been wrong. If he said that there’s no collusion, he’s right.\" Whitaker's appointment has been the subject much controversy, particularly as it relates to his role overseeing Mueller's probe. Top Democrats have called for his \"immediate recusal,\" citing his past commentary critical of Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russians to influence the election. On Friday, opponents of the appointment asked the U.S. Supreme Court to rule that Whitaker is not legally qualified to serve as acting attorney general. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice offered an opinion defending the legality of Whitaker's appointment last week. In an interview with \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, an ally of the president, said he had \"nothing against\" Whitaker, adding, however, \"I don’t know if he’s the best choice.\" \"There are a lot of choices out there,\" Graham added. The senator said he \"would encourage the president to pick someone\" to nominate as attorney general \"very soon.\" Speaking to Wallace, Trump said it's up to Whitaker to decide on curtailing Mueller's probe in any way. \"I think he’s very well aware politically,\" Trump said of Whitaker. \"I think he’s astute politically. He’s a very smart person. A very respected person. He’s going to do what’s right. I really believe he’s going to do what’s right.\" On Mueller, Trump all but shut down the idea that he would sit for an interview with the special counsel, adding that he will soon turn over his answers to written questions to the special counsel \"at some point very soon.\" Asked if there would be \"no interview\" with Mueller, Trump said he thought \"we've wasted enough time on this witch hunt and the answer is probably, we’re finished\" after he submits the written answers. \"What are the odds?\" Wallace asked of an interview. \"One in a hundred?\" \"I don’t do odds,\" Trump responded before Wallace cut in to point out that, \"You ran a casino sir.\" \"You’re right, and very successfully actually,\" Trump said. \"We gave very, very complete answers to a lot of questions that I shouldn’t have even been asked and I think that should solve the problem. I hope it solves the problem, if it doesn’t, you know, I’ll be told and we’ll make a decision at that time. But probably this is the end.\" NBC News reported earlier Sunday that the president's legal team plans to submit answers to Mueller by Thanksgiving, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Donald Trump and his defenders are having a hard time explaining hush money scandal after Michael Cohen's guilty plea. Is impeachment next? Michael Cohen (Photo: Jason Szenes/epa-EFE) Caught flatfooted by Michael Cohen’s sudden guilty plea to crimes he swore he committed at the direction of President Trump, the president and his defenders have trotted out three lines of defense in the last 24 hours. All of them are wrong, and one of them is outrageous. The first is to actually deny that the president has been implicated in criminal conduct at all. Thus Rudy Giuliani reportedly asserted Tuesday that the charges to which Cohen pleaded include no allegation “of any wrongdoing” by the president. And Trump himself, bafflingly, tweeted out that Cohen pleaded guilty to “two counts of campaign finance violations that are not a crime.” Defending Trump is getting harder to do This first line of defense is nothing short of silly. Cohen swore in open court that the president — identified in the charging document as “Individual -1” not only joined but directed his criminal activity. (And the president’s suggestion that the two counts of the document that involve him are not crimes is incoherent.) Second, Giuliani, in his familiar attack-dog posture, asserted that Cohen’s sworn allegations were themselves lies, and that Cohen had engaged in “a pattern of lies and dishonesty over a significant period of time.” This of course is the standard refrain of defendants when former co-conspirators cooperate with the government. And certainly Cohen comes to the government with a long trail of lies, many made in his loyal service to the president. But the attacks flounder for several reasons. First, and most importantly, Cohen brings to the government a wealth of corroborating evidence that strongly reinforces his account of the president’s involvement, including the taped conversation between Cohen and the president that establishes the president’s knowing involvement in the payout scheme. Cohen’s conduct, moreover, according to the charging document, was “coordinated with one or more members of the campaign.” And other important witnesses are likely to support Cohen’s account, such as David Pecker, CEO of American Media which publishes the National Enquirer, who has been cooperating with the government, not to mention Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal themselves. More: After Manafort conviction & Cohen plea, Donald Trump is so desperate he could do anything Donald Trump supporters, Catholics and African-Americans share a costly burden Fox News went all in for Donald Trump. In its eyes, the president can do no wrong. Cohen’s taped conversation put the lie to Trump’s previous and repeated denials of any knowledge of the hush agreements. Indeed, as impeachable as Cohen may be, the president himself starts any credibility battle with Cohen in the hole because of his own trail of lies. These began four days before the election when his spokeswoman Hope Hicks categorically asserted that “we” — the campaign — “have no knowledge” of the McDougal affair or coverup. Those false denials were repeated, including by the president himself when he denied knowing about any payment to Stormy Daniels. So we have the sworn statements in court against self-interest by Cohen, with extensive corroboration, as against the self-interested, unsworn, uncorroborated, and, based on his track record of promiscuous lies, untrustworthy avowals of the president. Add to that Trump’s elaborate gymnastics to avoid answering any questions under oath. It is hard to see how he can prevail in a credibility battle even with Cohen. Donald Trump's actions were not typical Team Trump’s third defense is to suggest that even if Trump directed the criminal activity, it was a trivial, barely criminal violation. Giuliani has hinted at this argument but probably its strongest articulation was by Professor Alan Dershowitz in the latest of defenses of the president on Fox News. Dershowitz compared the crimes to a “kind of jaywalking in the realm of things about elections,\" and the sort of trifling conduct that “every candidate” violates. This final claim is not only wrongheaded but pernicious. It attempts to analogize Cohen’s crimes, and Trump’s direction of them, to a technical oversight, a mere failure to file reports. The account completely distorts and understates the elaborate conspiracy that Cohen detailed and that was undertaken at Trump’s direction expressly for the purpose of influencing the election. McDougal and Daniels needed to be paid and silenced — and the silence covered up — in order to prevent the political fallout to a candidate who had barely weathered the disclosure of the Access Hollywood tape. The campaign-finance aspect of the crimes are a near-incidental detail in the context of the scheme’s purpose — a payment of hush money to influence an election. It is far more akin to the payment of bribes, or practice of dirty tricks as in Watergate, to secure an improper campaign advantage. This then, far from a regulatory violation, represents the sort of grave corrupt conduct that threatens democratic institutions and casts a shadow on the legitimacy of the election. Impeachment was designed in part as a response to just this sort of attempt to exploit and corrupt the system in order to gain political office. As George Mason put it at the Constitutional Convention, “Shall the man who has practiced corruption, and by that means procured his appointment in the first instance, be suffered to escape punishment by repeating his guilt?” That is a question that the Congress — and especially the Republican members of Congress, whose unprincipled toadying to the president appears to date to have no limit — may soon need to answer.

{"global_context": "The Senate on Thursday approved former coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler to head the Environmental Protection Agency by a vote of 52 to 47, elevating a veteran of Washington political and industry circles who has advanced President Donald Trump's push to roll back Obama-era environmental regulations. Wheeler, who began his career at the EPA during the 1990s and spent years on Capitol Hill before heading to the private sector, has elicited praise from Republicans for his deregulatory agenda and criticism from Democrats for his refusal to take action on climate change and several public health priorities. He has been running the agency since Trump's first administrator, Scott Pruitt, stepped down in July amid scandals surrounding his management and spending practices. Trump said in November that he intended to nominate Wheeler for the top job, saying he had done a \"fantastic job\" in his interim role. At his confirmation hearing in January, Wheeler highlighted dozens of significant rules that the EPA has begun to roll back in the past two years, and he made clear to lawmakers that he intended to continue the Trump administration's reversal of environmental regulations. \"Through our deregulatory actions, the Trump administration has proven that burdensome federal regulations are not necessary to drive environmental progress,\" Wheeler said at the time. \"Certainty, and the innovation that thrives in a climate of certainty, are key to progress.\" Despite the litany of rollbacks, the EPA under Wheeler also has began initiatives aimed at reducing lead exposure around the country and providing oversight for a class of unregulated, long-lasting chemicals known as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl compounds, or PFAS, that pose serious health risks to millions of Americans. But the agency has yet to take definitive regulatory action on those proposals. One Republican, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, voted against Wheeler's confirmation Thursday on the grounds that he had worked to water down federal rules curbing greenhouse gas pollution from power plants and to weaken fuel standards for the nation's cars and pickup trucks. \"I believe that Mr. Wheeler, unlike Scott Pruitt, understands the mission of the EPA and acts in accordance with ethical standards; however, the policies he has supported as Acting Administrator are not in the best interest of our environment and public health, particularly given the threat of climate change to our nation,\" Collins, who supported Wheeler's confirmation as deputy EPA administrator last year, said in a statement. While Democrats initially viewed Wheeler as a pragmatic technocrat with whom they could forge a handful of policy compromises, they expressed disappointment over key decisions he has made at the agency. Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, had voted to confirm Wheeler as EPA deputy administrator last year. But opposed Wheeler's confirmation this time, he said, in light of his push to freeze vehicle fuel efficiency standards and to revisit the cost-benefit analysis the agency used to impose limits on mercury pollution that power companies have already achieved. \"As Acting Administrator, he hasn't demonstrated a desire or a will to make any meaningful progress on clean drinking water standards and has rolled back clean air standards that are directly impacting West Virginians,\" Manchin said in a statement. Democrats used the vote as an opportunity to call for greater action on climate change, with more than six senators speaking to a nearly empty chamber about why the federal government should press for steeper cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. \"It ought to tell us a lot that the Republicans put up a coal lobbyist to represent the people of America, leading the Environmental Protection Agency,\" said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I. The world has warmed more than 1 degree Celsius since pre-industrial levels, and a United Nations report last fall concluded that humans need to cut their carbon emissions nearly in half over the coming decade to stave off the most catastrophic impacts of climate change. So far, that appears unlikely, as many nations aren't hitting the emissions targets they set as part of the 2015 Paris climate accord. Global emissions also rose in 2018. But most Republicans, including Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman John Barrasso of Wyoming, said Wheeler had eased the burden on industry without undermining key environmental protections. Barrasso pointed to the EPA's push to scale back limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and the federal government's jurisdiction over water bodies in the United States. \"During the last administration, the EPA issued punishing regulations that would hurt the economy and raise costs on families,\" Barrasso said. \"Under acting Administrator Wheeler's leadership, the EPA has taken a different approach.\" Industry officials credited Wheeler as helping spur the economy by restraining what they view as federal overreach. \"Regulatory certainty has been key to the historic manufacturing job growth we've seen under the current administration, and that would not have been possible without Andrew's leadership at EPA,\" Jay Timmons, president and CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers said in an statement. And Karen Harbert, president and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Global Energy Institute, said Wheeler's \"extensive experience\" had prepared him to serve as the nation's top environmental official.

{"global_context": "Trump Jr. posted a meme over the weekend that mocked a confidential letter that Christine Blasey Ford sent over the summer to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) detailing her allegations against Kavanaugh. A day after Donald Trump Jr. appeared to mock Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh of sexual assault, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway showed support for Ford, saying that she “should not be insulted, and she should not be ignored.” Ford recently spoke out against Kavanaugh, whom she alleges sexually assaulted her when the two were teenagers, raising critical questions only days before his confirmation vote was set to take place. Some lawmakers are now calling for the vote to be delayed. Trump Jr. posted what appeared to be a meme over the weekend, showing a picture of an apparent schoolboy love note with the caption: “Judge Kavanaughs sexual assault letter found by Dems.” The satirical note shared by Trump Jr. was written in crayon, reading “Hi Cindy will you be my girlfreind.” It included two boxes, one for “yes” and one for “no,” and it was signed, “Love Bret.” It appeared to be mocking a confidential letter that Ford sent over the summer to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, detailing her allegations against Kavanaugh. “Oh boy . . . the Dems and their usual nonsense games really have him on the ropes now,” Trump Jr. wrote, claiming that Feinstein had saved the letter and released it in time for the vote. “Honorable as always,” Trump Jr. added. A representative for Trump Jr. could not immediately be reached for comment by The Washington Post. [California professor, writer of confidential Brett Kavanaugh letter, speaks out about her allegation of sexual assault] Conway said Monday on “Fox & Friends” that Ford “should be heard,” but, she added, “so should he,” saying that both Ford and Kavanaugh are expected to give their accounts in sworn testimony that will then be provided to lawmakers in time for the vote. Conway did not directly address the meme Trump Jr. tweeted. Conway also showed support for Kavanaugh, who has denied the allegations, saying that he is “a man of character and integrity” who has been vetted by the FBI and “lauded” by women who have known him throughout his life. President Trump has also defended Kavanaugh, telling reporters, “We want to go through a full process . . . and hear everybody out.” According to The Post’s Emma Brown, who wrote about Ford and her accusations against the Supreme Court nominee: Speaking publicly for the first time, Ford said that one summer in the early 1980s, Kavanaugh and a friend — both “stumbling drunk,” Ford alleges — corralled her into a bedroom during a gathering of teenagers at a house in Montgomery County. While his friend watched, she said, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it. When she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth. “I thought he might inadvertently kill me,” said Ford, now a 51-year-old research psychologist in northern California. “He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.” Ford said she was able to escape when Kavanaugh’s friend and classmate at Georgetown Preparatory School, Mark Judge, jumped on top of them, sending all three tumbling. She said she ran from the room, briefly locked herself in a bathroom and then fled the house. Ford did not wait until the eve of the vote to come forward with her allegations. Brown wrote that Ford had contacted The Post in July, “when it had become clear that Kavanaugh was on the shortlist of possible nominees,” but she did not speak on the record for weeks “as she grappled with concerns about what going public would mean for her and her family — and what she said was her duty as a citizen to tell the story.” After Trump Jr. posted the meme on Instagram, Lynne Patton, a top official with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, commented on it, using emoji showing a laughing smiley face and raised hands, according to Mediaite. She later released a statement saying that she was not trivializing sexual assault. “To the contrary,” she tweeted, “my post was in response to the hypocrisy highlighted by @DonaldJTrumpJr inasmuch that @SenFeinstein concealed Ms. Ford’s letter for 2 mos, releasing it only when the timing best suited her own. True exploitation.” Not everyone approved. Republican former congressman Joe Walsh criticized the president’s son, calling him “an uncaring, narrow-minded idiot.” No matter your take on the accusations against Brett Kavanaugh, I think we all can agree that @DonaldJTrumpJr is an uncaring, narrow-minded idiot.https://t.co/56Wnlhz3Dw — Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) September 17, 2018 Walsh also called out Democrats for waiting until the last moment to “drop this dirt.” So Dems waited until the very last minute to drop this dirt, and now they want to wait again to hear from her?

{"global_context": "Zimbabwe’s constitutional court has upheld the election of Emmerson Mnangagwa as the president of the country. After replacing Mr. Mugabe in November, Mr. Mnangagwa has been eager to gain legitimacy and would repeatedly say in public that “the people’s voice is the voice of God.” The ouster of Mr. Mugabe did bring about the end of petty oppression. The police stopped harassing and taking bribes from drivers on the roads. Zimbabweans actively exercised their newfound freedom to speak out: Many energetically insulted President Mnangagwa in their comments on his social media accounts. Murehwa, my ancestral village in Zimbabwe, is a ZANU-PF stronghold. In late March, as the campaign season was picking up, my family was surprised to see Mr. Chamisa lead the first opposition rally in the area in years, without any incident. In April, I attended a performance of “Operation Restore Regasi,” a political satire about the ouster of Mr. Mugabe, in Harare. The play was directed by the celebrated Zimbabwean playwright Daves Guzha. In late July, I had an event about a book I wrote interrogating the events and history leading up to Mr. Mugabe’s fall at the same venue. Despite concerns about the wisdom of holding such an event in high electoral season, we were freely able to discuss controversial subjects such as Gukurahundi — the term used in Zimbabwe to describe the killing and torture of thousands of civilians from the Ndebele minority in the Matabeleland province between 1983 and 1987. The Ndebeles were accused of being “dissident” supporters of Joshua Nkomo, a rival of Mr. Mugabe. Mr. Mnangagwa ran internal security for Mr. Mugabe at the time. Despite these tentative democratic openings, the cynicism about a fair electoral process remained. On the eve of the elections, a young cousin who supports the charismatic and young Mr. Chamisa remarked, “The boy will win, but the old man will rule.” Many of us, though hopeful about change, were hard-pressed to see an outcome where the old men, the veterans of the liberation struggle of the 1970s, would cede to young Mr. Chamisa the power they consolidated after deposing Mr. Mugabe. In early August, Mr. Chamisa’s supporters poured into the streets of Harare disputing the election results. In contrast to November, when Zimbabweans formed an unprecedented alliance with the military to force out Mr. Mugabe, the military and the police used tear gas, water canons and live bullets against protesters from the opposition.

CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — An Australian senator was censured by his colleagues on Wednesday for seeking to blame the victims of last month’s mosque shootings and vilify Muslims. Sen. Fraser Anning was the target of widespread condemnation for blaming the attack in New Zealand on immigration policies. He faced more criticism later for physically striking a teenager who cracked a raw egg on his head in a viral incident in Melbourne. On Parliament’s second sitting day since the March 15 attack in which 50 people died, government and opposition lawmakers moved the censure motion against Anning for divisive comments “seeking to attribute blame to victims of a horrific crime and to vilify people on the basis of religion, which do not reflect the opinions of the Australian Senate or the Australian people.” “Sen. Anning’s comments were ugly and divisive. They were dangerous and unacceptable from anyone, let alone a member of this place,” Government Senate Leader Mathias Cormann told the Senate. Anning dismissed the censure motion as an attack on free speech. “It is also an exercise in left-wing virtue signaling of the worst kind,” he told the Senate before the vote. Rod McGuirk / ASSOCIATED PRESS Australian Senator Fraser Anning gives a speech in Parliament House in Canberra, Australia, Wednesday, April 3, 2019. He sits as an independent lawmaker after defecting from the anti-Muslim One Nation party, whose two senators abstained from the censure vote. One Nation Sen. Peter Georgiou read a speech on behalf of party leader Pauline Hanson, who was absent. Hanson said while Anning’s comments were “untimely and therefore deemed highly insensitive, he still maintains a right to his opinion.” “If One Nation endorses your action to censure Sen. Anning, your freedom of speech as elected members of this chamber will be removed,” the speech said. A day after the Christchurch attacks, Anning faced more criticism for physically striking the teenager who cracked an egg on his head at a Melbourne public appearance — 17-year-old Will Connolly, who became known around the world as “Egg Boy.” Anning on Wednesday criticized Prime Minister Scott Morrison for saying at the time that Anning should “be subject to the full force of the law” for his retaliation against Connolly. Police investigated the altercation but no charges have been announced. “It might have only been an idiot with an egg this time, but there is a continuum that begins with this and ends with a fanatic with a gun or a bomb,” Anning said. “But apparently, according to Prime Minister Morrison, that’s OK, as long as the victims are conservatives,” he added.

Both men share the same elite education at Eton College, Britain’s most famous private school, and Balliol College at Oxford University, but their politics are far apart.

If he can make the shortlist of two, something that now seems assured, Mr. Johnson should have one foot in Downing Street.

{"global_context": "The full moon was the only light as a terrified 9-year-old boy from Central African Republic climbed into a rubber dinghy held together with duct tape, risking death in the dark waters off Libya along with his parents and 57 other trafficked immigrants. After a long night on the Mediterranean Sea, a Spanish rescue boat spotted them on the horizon after dawn. \"People were screaming, I was afraid,\" said the boy, Krisley Dokouada. \"But after seeing the rescue boat, I knew there was no more danger.\" Their savior Saturday was the Open Arms, which became the third rescue ship run by humanitarian aid groups to draw the ire of Italy's anti-immigrant interior minister, Matteo Salvini. He has vowed that Italy's new populist government will no longer allow such rescue boats to dock in Italy, which has taken in hundreds of thousands of migrants rescued at sea in the last few years. Malta then angrily rebuffed Salvini's claim that the tiny Mediterranean nation was closest to the rescue ship and should give it safe harbor. That left Open Arms, operated by the Spanish group Proactiva Open Arms, relieved that all were safely rescued but without knowing where or when the boat will reach land. Later Saturday, in an unrelated rescue much further west, Spanish authorities reported saving another 63 people trying to reach the country's southern coast from North Africa. While European politicians bickered about where the immigrants should go, those rescued by the Open Arms were jubilant — jumping, chanting and hugging their rescuers.

With sparkling eyes, the only child among the migrants smiled shyly after the rescue crew called him \"captain.\" For months, his family had lived in Libya, while they awaited their chance to make the Mediterranean crossing. His mother, Judith Dokouada, said she never left the shelter for fear of being kidnapped or sold as a slave, a fate many African migrants have spoken of to human rights advocates. \"There is war at home. They kill people, they beat people, they rape women, they kill boys,\" said Dokouada, 32. \"We don't have peace.\" She and her husband want to raise Krisley in a safer place. She expressed hope the family could apply for refugee status and settle in Spain. Another of those rescued, Bitcha Honoree, said he knew the risk he was taking when he boarded the dinghy in the middle of the night. The 39-year-old man from Cameroon said that he was sold twice as a slave, kidnapped and tortured in Libya while awaiting his chance to get aboard a smuggler's boat. His brother sold his home in order to pay the ransom demanded by his captors in largely lawless Libya.

The U.N. refugee agency says 1,137 migrants are estimated to have died on Mediterranean so far this year. And that does not include the 100 migrants reported missing and feared dead at sea Friday off the coast of Libya. A few hours after the Open Arms rescue Saturday, Salvini declared that the Spanish rescue boat \"can forget about arriving in an Italian port\" and claimed it should go to Malta. \"Quit spreading incorrect news, dragging Malta into it for no reason,\" Maltese Interior Minister Michael Farrugia tweeted, claiming the tiny Italian island of Lampedusa, south of Sicily, was closer. Even though the number of migrants arriving in Europe is sharply down this year from 2017, migration issues have deepened political divisions in the European Union, fueled in part by the demands of anti-migrant nationalist parties. But cracks showed Saturday between the two coalition parties in Italy's new populist government over Salvini's hard-line approach. Roberto Fico, a leading figure in the 5-Star Movement, the senior partner in Italy's ruling coalition, told reporters after inspecting a migrant reception center in Sicily that \"I wouldn't close the ports.\" Fico described Libya as unsafe and praised the humanitarian aid ships for doing \"extraordinary work\" in the Mediterranean. Salvini contended Saturday on Twitter that the Open Arms had taken on the migrants before a Libyan boat in Libya's search-and-rescue zone could intervene. But the Open Arms' captain, Marco Martinez, said he told the Rome-based Maritime Rescue Coordination Center about the migrants and was instructed to call Libyan maritime authorities, who didn't answer. The captain said officials in Rome then told him it was up to him to decide whether to carry out the rescue. \"I took the decision to save these human beings,\" Martinez told an Associated Press journalist who viewed the rescue from a dinghy belonging to its sister ship Astral. The AP journalist saw a Libyan coast guard vessel approached the Open Arms and the Astral as the rescue was being concluded, but it made a U-turn and left, ordering both boats to return to Spain. Also witnessing the rescue were four European Parliament lawmakers. The mayor of the Spanish port city of Barcelona, Ada Colau, urged Spain's new prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, to permit the Open Arms to dock in her city. \"Barcelona doesn't want to be an accomplice to the policies of death of Matteo Salvini,\" she declared.

{"global_context": "By KEN THOMAS and SUSANNAH GEORGE WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration ordered the closure of the Palestinian diplomatic mission in Washington on Monday, citing the refusal of Palestinian leaders to enter into peace talks with Israel. The Palestinians accused the administration of dismantling decades of U.S. engagement with them. The State Department said the U.S. step — the latest in a series targeting the Palestinians — came after a review of the office of the Palestine Liberation Organization centered on the fact that no “direct and meaningful negotiations with Israel” are underway despite previous warnings. “To the contrary, PLO leadership has condemned a U.S. peace plan they have not yet seen and refused to engage with the U.S. government with respect to peace efforts and otherwise,” spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement. “As such, and reflecting congressional concerns, the administration has decided that the PLO office in Washington will close at this point.” The Trump administration had told the Palestinians last November that closure could be expected unless they agreed to sit to down with the Israelis. The administration, however, has yet to release its own much-vaunted but largely unknown peace plan although it said it still intends to do so. “The United States continues to believe that direct negotiations between the two parties are the only way forward,” Nauert said in her statement. “This action should not be exploited by those who seek to act as spoilers to distract from the imperative of reaching a peace agreement. We are not retreating from our efforts to achieve a lasting and comprehensive peace.” She also said the closure decision was consistent with U.S. concerns about Palestinian attempts to prompt an investigation of Israel by the International Criminal Court. National Security Adviser John Bolton was expected to address Monday’s decision in a speech later in the day focused on U.S. policy toward the ICC. Palestinian official Saeb Erekat said the closure was “yet another affirmation of the Trump administration’s policy to collectively punish the Palestinian people, including by cutting financial support for humanitarian services including health and education.” The Palestine Liberation Organization, commonly known as the PLO, formally represents all Palestinians. Although the U.S. does not recognize Palestinian statehood, the PLO has maintained in Washington a general delegation office that facilitates Palestinian officials’ interactions with the U.S. government. The head of the PLO delegation to the U.S. accused the Trump administration of “dismantling decades of U.S. vision and engagement in Palestine.” “Weaponizing humanitarian and developmental aid as political blackmail does not work,” Ambassador Husam Zomlot said. Trump has delivered a number of blows to the Palestinians during his time in office. Most recently his administration ended U.S. funding for the United Nations agency that helps Palestinian refugees, slashing hundreds of millions of dollars in aid for projects in the West Bank and Gaza and cutting funding to hospitals in Jerusalem that serve Palestinians. Trump also recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moved the U.S. Embassy there, from Tel Aviv. Dozens of Palestinians were killed in protests that followed the move, and Palestinians have since rejected the U.S. as a peace broker. Although the Israelis and Palestinians are not engaged in active, direct negotiations, Trump’s administration has been working to mediate a peace deal that would end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Led by Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and a senior aide, White House officials have been preparing a peace proposal they intend to put forward at an unspecified time. Trump has promised to pursue the “ultimate deal” between the Palestinians and Israel. However, such a deal is unlikely given Palestinian mistrust of his administration. ____ Associated Press writer Matthew Lee contributed to this report.

The Senate keeps seven but lowers them all: 10%, 12%, 22.5%, 25%, 32.5%, 35% and 38.5%. Child tax credit: Increases from $1,000 to $1,600 in House bill, $1,650 in Senate bill per child. Corporate cut: The House would lower the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% next year, and the Senate would do it starting in 2019. Estate tax: The House would double the current exemption to apply only to estates worth more than $10 million next year, and phase the tax out completely over six years; Senate would double the exemption next year but otherwise keep the tax. Major medical expenses: Deduction for expenses that exceed 10% of a taxpayer's income would be eliminated by the House; the Senate does not change this deduction. Mortgage interest: For new mortgages, only interest on the first $500,000 borrowed for a primary home would be deductible under the House bill, and interest on mortgages for second homes and home equity loans would no longer be deductible; the Senate would not not change the current limit, which is for the first $1 million borrowed, but would end the deduction for home equity loans. State and local taxes: The House bill would allow a deduction for up to $10,000 in property taxes, but end deductions for income or sales taxes; the Senate would eliminate all of them. Student loan interest: Deduction eliminated by the House bill; left intact by the Senate. Teacher purchases: Deduction for teachers who buy supplies for their classrooms would be eliminated by the House bill but left in place by the Senate.

{"global_context": "Hillary Clinton knows we are already in the danger zone when it comes to the political temperature. Her comments are as reckless as bringing a can of gasoline to a bonfire. Two events from the last two days stand out. The first came Monday night with President Trump’s forceful yet compassionate speech at the swearing in of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. The president opened with an extraordinary apology on behalf of the country to Kav­anaugh and his family “for the terrible pain and suffering” they endured during the historically brutal confirmation process. He said the unfounded allegations violated fairness and “the presumption of innocence.” Trump also tenderly addressed Kavanaugh’s young daughters, telling them “your father is a great man, a man of decency, character, kindness and courage.” The event was something of a spike-the-football moment in front of a cheering White House audience and as such was a clever piece of stagecraft, where Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell, Charles Grassley, Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins were saluted. But the ceremony was much more than mere boosterism. With the eight other Supremes sitting in the front row, Trump aimed to restore dignity to the judiciary at a time when the dirtiest tricks of politics have buried the court in a mountain of mud. The president is right to worry that the character-assassination attempt on Kavanaugh may turn out to be a seminal moment in American political and cultural history. The ideas that the court is just another political branch and that the presumption of innocence no longer applies if you are on the other team represent a seismic shift in how we look at each other and the nation as a whole. If those ideas stick, we are in more trouble than we can imagine. And while Trump has at times unnecessarily contributed to the rancor, he was terrific Monday in trying to repair what Senate Democrats and their media handmaidens tried to destroy. Which brings me to the second event of note: Hillary Clinton’s statement Tuesday that Democrats “cannot be civil” as long as Republicans hold the White House and Congress. “You cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about,” Clinton told CNN. “That’s why I believe, if we are fortunate enough to win back the House and/or the Senate, that’s when civility can start again. But until then, the only thing that the Republicans seem to recognize and respect is strength.” There you have it — a declaration of war and a license for violence. Where is the media outrage? Clinton knows we are already in the danger zone when it comes to the political temperature. Her comments, then, are as reckless as bringing a can of gasoline to a bonfire. She’s stoking trouble to gain a foothold in the 2020 race — and damn the consequences. Her claim that civility can return when Dems have power is an admission that the ends justify the means. Then again, she never fails to disappoint. As I wrote Sunday, she has spent the last two years casting doubt on the legitimacy of the Trump presidency because the election didn’t go her way. That makes her guilty of the very thing she found “horrifying” when Trump suggested he might not abide by the results if he thought they were rigged. “He is denigrating — he is talking down our democracy. And I am appalled that someone who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that position,” she said in their final debate, in October 2016. She added, “That is not the way our democracy works.” But it does work exactly that way when Democrats are denied what they feel entitled to. They should be careful what they wish for. For if the Kavanaugh experience revealed anything, it is that Trump’s GOP knows how to fight back and win. It is hard to imagine that Kavanaugh would have survived such an onslaught under any other ­recent Republican candidate or president. There were so many reasons, and so much media pressure, that it would not have been surprising if a bloc of senators called the allegations a “distraction” and waved a white flag. They didn’t because Trump and Kavanaugh didn’t back down. Still, there is danger when two sides both think they can outlast the other. Responding to my concern that America might be sleepwalking into a second civil war, a number of readers agreed. Some said they welcomed it. Curt Doolittle wrote this: “We aren’t sleepwalking into it, we know exactly what we’re doing and why. The hard right and hard left are planning on it, ready for it, and looking for an opportunity.” He said the pressure has been building and that “the only reason it hasn’t turned hot is the outlier of Trump’s election. If Clinton had won, we’d already be there.”.

On Election Day, Scott appeared poised to defeat the longtime incumbent. But as more votes have been counted in counties such as Broward and Palm Beach, Scott's lead has narrowed to the point where, under Florida law, an automatic machine recount is triggered. That recount began this weekend and must be completed by Thursday, though lawsuits filed by both Scott and Nelson's camps could complicate that timeline. A spokesman for Scott responded to Nelson Monday, saying in a statement that Democrat is \"once again confused.\" \"The recount is being managed by the individual and independent Supervisors of Elections in all 67 counties,\" the spokesman added. \"If Bill Nelson has an issue with the way the recount is being run, he should take it up with them.\" Republicans such as Scott and President Donald Trump have insisted that Democrats are trying to \"steal\" the election, with each suggesting that rampant voter fraud could be taking place in the key Democratic-leaning counties. \"Every Floridian should be concerned there may be rampant fraud happening in Palm Beach and Broward Counties,\" Scott said Thursday. \"We've all seen the incompetence and the irregularities in vote tabulations in Broward and Palm Beach for years. Well, here we go again. I will not sit idly by while unethical liberals try to steal this election from the great people of Florida.\" No evidence of such fraud has been brought forth. State election officials said they have not seen any evidence of fraud. As of Monday morning, Scott holds a lead of about 13,000 votes, while former GOP Rep. Ron DeSantis has an edge of about 33,000 votes over Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum in the battle for governor that is also going through an automatic recount. NBC News has rated DeSantis as the apparent winner and the Senate race as too close to call. Trump joined in on Monday morning, calling for an end to the recount and for the Republicans to be declared victorious. Without offering any evidence, Trump claimed ballots were \"massively infected.\" Gillum quickly shot back, saying the president sounded \"nervous\" about the recount.

{"global_context": "The plan, hatched by White House chief of staff John F. Kelly, is expected to be set in motion over the next few weeks. The White House has a plan to replace Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with CIA Director Mike Pompeo, after months of rockiness between Tillerson and President Trump. (The Washington Post) The White House has readied a plan to oust embattled Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and replace him with CIA Director Mike Pompeo, who has become one of the most personally loyal and politically savvy members of President Trump's national security team, two administration officials confirmed Thursday. The plan, hatched by White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, is expected to be set in motion over the next few weeks, and it has broad support within Trump's inner circle, the officials said. But it was unclear whether Trump had signed off on the plan yet; the president has been known to change his mind about personnel and other matters before finalizing decisions with public announcements. Under the plan, Pompeo would probably be replaced at the CIA by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), one of Trump's most steadfast defenders and a confidant to some leading members of the foreign policy team, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the White House has not publicly announced the moves. Left: Mike Pompeo at a Senate confirmation hearing to be CIA director (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post). Secretary of State Rex Tillerson speaks about North Korea during the White House daily press briefing on Nov. 20 (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post). The New York Times was the first to report Kelly's plan. Asked during a Thursday morning meeting with the crown prince of Bahrain, Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, whether he wants Tillerson to remain as secretary of state, Trump told reporters: “He's here. Rex is here.” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders did not dispute the reporting of the plan to replace Tillerson, but she noted that Tillerson remains in his job and is working to “close out what has been a successful year.” Asked at her afternoon news briefing whether Trump has confidence in Tillerson, Sanders would not answer explicitly. “When the president loses confidence in someone, they will no longer serve in the capacity that they’re in,” she said. In an earlier statement, Sanders told reporters: “There are no personnel announcements at this time.” As for how Tillerson can serve effectively as the nation's top diplomat amid doubts about his longevity, Sanders told reporters, “The secretary of state’s a pretty tough guy, and I think he’ll be just fine carrying his job out.” At the State Department, meanwhile, spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Tillerson is going about his job as usual, including two visits to the White House on Thursday. She said Kelly called Tillerson's office on Thursday morning to say reports about the White House replacing him were “not true.” “Secretary Tillerson enjoys this job. He has a lot of work to do,” Nauert said. She added, “He does serve at the pleasure of the president.” Asked about her boss's relationship with Trump, Nauert said: “The president respects Secretary Tillerson. The have had, certainly, a cordial relationship. Where that stands today, I cannot speak to that.” A spokesperson for Pompeo at the CIA declined to comment. And as for Cotton, the senator's spokesman, Caroline Rabbitt Tabler, said, “Senator Cotton's focus is on serving Arkansans in the Senate.” [‘Death spiral’: Tillerson makes nice but may not last long with Trump] Throughout this autumn, Tillerson's departure has been widely expected, given his rocky relationship with the president, and Pompeo has been seen as a top contender to succeed Tillerson at Foggy Bottom. Chatter about Tillerson's potential ouster reached a fever pitch in October, after NBC News reported that Tillerson had called Trump a “moron.” Though Tillerson had told friends he wanted to make it as secretary of state for a full year and has insisted publicly that he had no plans to quit, rumors of his impending departure gained a nickname — Rexit. The secretary of state has alienated both onetime allies at the White House and his underlings at the State Department with what many call a highhanded and tone-deaf manner. Tillerson’s main project, a downsizing and streamlining of the State Department bureaucracy, is still a work in progress, but it has drawn widespread criticism on Capitol Hill, from leading congressional Republicans as well as Democrats. President Trump and his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson have been on shaky ground for weeks, and Trump's challenge of an 'IQ test' face-off with Tillerson isn't smoothing things over. Here's a look back at where their relationship derailed. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) Tillerson's closest ally in Washington may be Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who spoke with Tillerson on Thursday and later dismissed reports about the secretary's departure. Corker suggested that Tillerson's rivals inside the administration were “seeking to undermine his presence.” “I don't think Secretary Tillerson's getting ready to be ousted,” Corker told reporters, noting that Tillerson talked with Trump on Thursday morning on a diplomatic call with another world leader. “It's been evident to me that, for some time, somebody has been seeking to undermine his presence. I don't know who that is.” Corker — who was considered for the secretary of state job a year ago but whose relationship with Trump has been badly strained in recent months — said of Tillerson's possible replacement, “I could barely pick Pompeo out of a lineup.” Corker added: “I just don't know him. That's not dismissive. I just don't have any frame of reference.” Pompeo, 53, has developed a close rapport with Trump through the president's regular intelligence briefings, which Pompeo often delivers personally in the Oval Office. A graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and Harvard Law School, Pompeo served in Congress for six years as a Republican representing a Kansas district. He was first elected in 2010 as part of the tea party wave. Tillerson, 65, had never worked in government and was largely unfamiliar with Washington when he accepted a surprise job offer from then President-elect Trump late last year. He had spent his entire professional career at ExxonMobil, where as chief executive officer he built a reputation as a shrewd dealmaker, with contacts across the Middle East and in Moscow. He famously accepted an honorary friendship medal directly from Russian President Vladimir Putin. As secretary of state, Tillerson has been frustrated by the slow pace and inefficiency of government, as well as what he has complained to friends is a culture of backstabbing and self-aggrandizement. At one point, Tillerson's likely successor appeared to be U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, a Republican and former governor from South Carolina, who has clashed with Tillerson. Over the past several weeks, however, both Haley and White House officials signaled that she would not likely be chosen to succeed Tillerson, in part because she is seen as not yet seasoned enough for the top diplomatic post. Haley insisted last month that she does not want the job and would reject it if it were offered. Tillerson accompanied Trump on part of his Asian trip earlier this month, and the pair gave no obvious sign of estrangement. Tillerson has kept up a steady schedule of appearances, including a speech Tuesday at the Woodrow Wilson Center in which he said the United States and European allies recognize the “active threat of a recently resurgent Russia.” Tillerson has stressed the importance of attempting dialogue and diplomacy with North Korea, even as Trump undercut him by saying the time for talk is over and that North Korea’s leadership only understands the threat of force. On Wednesday morning, Tillerson told reporters that a “long list” of additional sanctions could still be applied to attempt to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. “As a diplomat, we keep working on it every day,” Tillerson said of the nonmilitary pressure campaign. On Wednesday afternoon, Trump again belittled North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as “Little rocket man” and a “sick puppy.” Cotton, meanwhile, has emerged as perhaps the senator most closely aligned with the White House on national security issues. Older and more senior Republican colleagues, including national security lions Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Corker, have been frequent critics of Trump policies and priorities. Cotton was the central congressional figure in the White House plan, unveiled last month, to back away from the Iran nuclear deal and throw the question of U.S. participation in the international agreement to Congress. Should Cotton be nominated and confirmed as CIA director, he would leave a Senate seat vacant in a reliably Republican state. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is said to prefer for Cotton to remain in the Senate but would not try to stand in his way should the Arkansan want the CIA post, according to one McConnell ally who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid. Republican operatives began considering who would make strong potential replacements for Cotton, should the plan come to fruition. Names being mentioned included Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin, U.S. Reps. Steve Womack and French Hill, and state Attorney General Leslie Rutledge. Josh Dawsey, Karoun Demirjian, Sean Sullivan and Greg Miller contributed to this report.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia said on Wednesday it was saddened and shocked by a “disrespectful” U.S. decision to rein back aid programs because of perceived democratic setbacks and defended its record on democracy. The White House said on Tuesday it was suspending or curtailing several Treasury, USAID and military assistance programs that support Cambodia’s military, taxation department and local authorities - all of which, it said, shared blame for recent instability. A Cambodian court on Tuesday ordered the seizure of the headquarters of the main opposition party, pending the payment of damages to Prime Minister Hun Sen, the latest blow to the dissolved opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party. Hun Sen, who has ruled Cambodia for more than 30 years, has forced the closure of an English-language newspaper and jailed government critics, including opposition leader Kem Sokha, whom he has accused of conspiring with the United States to overthrow him. Rights groups and Western nations have decried the crackdown on the opposition ahead of a general election set for July 29. “Besides being saddened and shocked over the decision by the friendly nation over development assistance, Cambodia is proud to maintain and continue democracy with energy,” government spokesman Phay Siphan told Reuters on Wednesday. Phay Siphan called the aid cut “disrespectful” and “dishonest” as it builds democracy. “Democracy belongs to the people, not to the party that is already dissolved,” he said. “Cambodia had a bitter experience during the interventions of the United States and Western nations, which tried to set up democracy between 1970 and 1975, and they failed,” he said. Hun Sen has never forgiven the United States for dropping bombs on Cambodia during the Vietnam War, which ended in 1975. Cambodia ranks among the world’s nations most littered with unexploded ordnance, says the Mines Advisory Group, which helps find and destroy unexploded devices that kill or injure an average of two Cambodians every week. The White House said that Washington had spent more than $1 billion in support for Cambodia and that assistance in health, agriculture and mine-clearing will continue.

{"global_context": "France’s lower house of parliament overwhelmingly approved a new counter-terrorism bill on Tuesday intended to make permanent several controversial measures put in place under a nearly two-year-old state of emergency. French police will be given wider search and arrest power and will be allowed to close places of worship accused of condoning terror under a controversial bill France’s lower house of parliament overwhelmingly approved on Tuesday. The counterterrorism bill will make permanent several measures put in place under a nearly two-year-old state of emergency. The National Assembly passed the counterterrorism bill Tuesday by a 415-127 vote, with 19 lawmakers not taking part in the ballot. The law will now be heading to the Senate in the next few days or weeks and then will return to the lower house for a final vote. The new legislation will allow authorities to confine suspected terrorism sympathizers to their neighborhoods, close places of worship accused of condoning terror and carry out more on-the-spot identity checks without the prior approval of a judge. It will also allow the government to increase security perimeters in places deemed at risk, such as train stations and airports. 5 ARRESTED IN PARIS AFTER WIRED EXPLOSIVES FOUND IN POSH NEIGHBORHOOD The law is expected to become permanent before a state of emergency, which was put in place after the 2015 Paris attacks, expires on November 1. The country has been under a state of emergency since the November 2015 Islamist attacks in Paris, which killed 130 people and left more than 400 injured. It’s the longest state of emergency since the Algerian War of the 1960s. In July, French President Emmanuel Macron pledged to lift the order and transfer certain exception emergency policing powers into permanent law. Interior Minister Gerard Collomb told parliament on Tuesday that the threat level was still “very serious.” “We are still in a state of war,” he added, according to BBC News. The new legislation encountered little public resistance as the country continues to reel from a string of terrorist attacks over the past two years. The conservative Le Figaro newspaper recently found that 57 percent of French people were in favor of enshrining the measures into law. ISIS CLAIMS RESPONSIBILITY FOR MARSEILLE TRAIN STATION ATTACK; 2 WOMEN KILLED Critics say the bill infringes on individual liberties and puts the country in a permanent state of emergency. \"The necessary control exerted by the judges to prevent abuses of individual rights are considerably weakened, leaving more discretionary powers to the police and administration,\" Pierre Bocquillon, a lecturer of politics at Britain's University of East Anglia, told Al Jazeera, said explaining the anti-terrorism law. \"By weakening the judiciary and empowering the executive, this represents a threat to the rule of law.\" UN experts also raised objections in a letter to the French government last week. Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Front party who ran a failed presidential bid, said the law did not go far enough in combatting the “Islamist ideology that is waging war on us,” according to France 24. Since the declaration of state of emergency, France has continued to battle against seemingly increased attacks on its people. Most recently – just this weekend – a suspected Tunisian radical stabbed two 20-year-old women to death in the Mediterranean port city of Marseille. The attack by 29-year-old Ahmed Hanachi, who was shot dead by anti-terrorism patrols, brings the number of people killed in attacks claimed by, or attributed to, jihadists since January 2015 to 241. The attack in Marseille was the 10th major attack since the state of emergency was imposed. Authorities say they have foiled 12 planned attacks so far this year, including arresting five people on Monday in a chic Paris neighborhood. A neighbor alerted authorities to suspicion activity early Saturday in an apartment building in the affluent 16th district of western Paris. Inside authorities said they found an apparent ready-to-detonate bomb. A firing device, made with a mobile phone and connected to several wires, had been attached to these cylinders, law enforcement sources told Le Point newspaper.

Donald Trump has never won America’s support for a border wall financed by US taxpayers, the idea for which he is now holding our government hostage. Seven percent of America believes that Congress should fund President Donald Trump’s wall on the U.S.-Mexico border in order to end the government shutdown. That fact is an enormous opportunity to change the dynamic between this Congress and this president. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi should address the nation and make the following offer to Trump: If he ends the shutdown now, Democrats will promise to negotiate to fund construction of the border wall after he has won an election in which that policy was a central issue. This is the critical fact that too much of the current debate seems to miss: Trump has no democratic mandate for his wall, and therefore no constitutionally moral justification to leverage the enormous power of the presidency to force Congress to accept it. Putting aside the argument about whether a president who is selected after winning not even a plurality of the vote could have any mandate at all, it is clear that the only mandate Trump could claim from 2016 is for a wall “paid for by Mexico.” In Washington, D.C., on Jan. 10, 2019. (Photo: Hannah Gaber/USA TODAY Network) Read more commentary: Shutdown drama: Trump, Pelosi alpha-dog posturing benefits payday lenders & Putin Donald Trump's government shutdown cripples FBI, raises terrorism risk Trump can call a 'national emergency,' but that doesn't mean he can build the wall That is not the wall he is now demanding. That wall, paid for by us, was a central issue in the 2018 campaign. The results from that election show America doesn’t want that wall either. Trump has therefore never won America’s support for the idea for which he is now holding America’s government hostage. That truth renders his demand democratically immoral. No doubt, he has the constitutional power. No doubt, his exercise of that power is not justified. US cannot afford unilateral brinksmanship Yet were Trump to have a clear mandate, he would have a justification for using the full power of his office to force agreement. In a divided government, each side gets a claim. And within the boundaries of at least a plausible claim to a democratic mandate, all bets are off. Such mandates are few; they define the core battle that could be said to have decided an election. They are the fights that determined who won and who lost. They are what an election “meant.” Everything else must live within a politics of principled compromise. The divided system of checks and balances that is the United States government cannot afford unilateral brinksmanship. It cannot function if each side treats every issue as if it were a core issue of principle or morality. A demand without a mandate is extortion Members of Congress come to Congress with different agendas, some liberal, some not. But the aim of governance must be to add those differences together and use them to find a common purpose that at least a majority might agree upon. Everyone, including the president, must work to get what they can, recognizing no one will get everything they want. The precedent that Trump has set is chilling, at least for our Constitution, at least within the era of partisan polarization. The job of the president is not to issue commands. It is to work with the other elected members of government to make government work. That dynamic depends fundamentally upon the support of the people. It should get loud or strident only with the overwhelming demand of the people. Without that demand, no side should give in to extortion. For without a mandate, extortion is precisely what it is.

{"global_context": "Chicago mayoral candidate Bill Daley slammed rivals Toni Preckwinkle and Susana Mendoza for seeking re-election while also eyeing the February mayor’s race as crazy, absurd and ridiculous. Daley lobbed the criticisms as he unveiled an ethics plan Thursday that included a provision that he would not raise campaign funds during the first three years of his term, if elected. He contrasted the commitment against Preckwinkle, the Cook County Board president, and Mendoza, the state comptroller. Both politicians are on the Nov. 6 ballot for re-election to their current jobs. Preckwinkle, who also chairs the Cook County Democratic Party, simultaneously launched a campaign for mayor last month. Mendoza has not ruled out running for mayor but has said she’s focused on her comptroller race. Petitions aiming to get Mendoza’s name on the ballot, however, have been circulated for weeks. READ MORE: Bill Daley, whose brother and father ran Chicago for 43 years, backs a term limit for mayor » CHICAGO MAYOR'S RACE: Who is in, who is out and who is still thinking about it » Daley said the prospect of both Preckwinkle and Mendoza running in a mayoral election three months after winning re-election to their current office is unacceptable. “There are two people running against me right now who are running for certain offices they hold and are running for re-election, and at the same time they are raising money for those elections, which are 10 days from now and they are raising money and doing another office that is four months from now. This is crazy,” Daley said, seemingly ignoring the fact that Mendoza has yet to launch a campaign. “They’re doing it while they’re on the government dime and payroll. There is too much of this wasted time, spending time raising money between elections, and it’s just ridiculous.” Daley himself has raised plenty of money — $1.7 million so far to catapult him to the front of the field. For their parts, Preckwinkle and Mendoza chose not to engage with Daley, who is the brother of one former mayor and the son of another. Jose M.

Daley singled Mendoza out for being coy about her mayoral intentions. Stacey Wescott/Chicago Tribune Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza has not ruled out a run for Chicago mayor.

She has told at least a dozen people I’ve talked to that she’s looking for money from that she’s running,” Daley said. “I’ve seen petitions on the street with her name, her address ... I don’t think that was done without her knowledge.” Pallasch did not respond to the allegation that Mendoza is behind the petitions being passed to get her on the ballot. Marty Castro, a prominent 2015 backer of Jesus “Chuy” Garcia’s mayoral campaign, has said he has been working to draft Mendoza to the race with “volunteers in wards across Chicago gathering signatures on behalf of” Mendoza. “The absurdity of two office holders, running for two jobs at the same time and basically raising and spending money for them, is like cheating the public and treating their sacred jobs as a joke,” Daley said. “It’s not like we don’t have problems in the state, the county or the city. C’mon. I’ve been around this business my whole life, OK? And the amount of time people spend on fundraising is ridiculous. And when you’re running for two offices, holding a public job, it’s kind of crazy.” Part of that family political business Daley didn’t mention: that brother Richard M.

Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said in a letter dated Nov. 7 that he was “deeply troubled” by reports that the Trump administration was barring aid workers “from shipping supplies or traveling to North Korea as they seek to provide the most basic humanitarian assistance.” Mr. Markey praised Mr. Trump’s decision to engage in diplomacy with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, but said the aid workers needed to be allowed to do their jobs. Aid groups provide a range of services, including agricultural training and surgery, but are finding it impossible to enter North Korea because of new State Department restrictions. “The humanitarian situation in North Korea is far too dire for these draconian policies,” Mr. Markey wrote in the letter to Mr. Trump that was also sent to Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary.

European leaders critical of Donald Trump’s decision to reimpose sanctions on Iran are now considering their own, after an alleged assassination plot in Denmark. Danish diplomats have asked for EU-level support after their intelligence services arrested an Iranian suspect with Norwegian citizenship who is allegedly connected to a plot to murder an Iranian opposition figure in their country, Fox News reports. The call is said to have won “broad support” in a meeting of EU ambassadors, with at least eight countries backing the sanctions call. “I appreciate the support from my colleague [Theresa May] today,” commented Danish prime minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen after the British leader backed him in a meeting. “In close collaboration with UK and other countries, we will stand up to Iran,” he added. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo offered American support to European countries impacted by Iranian activity in the wake of the assassination plots, commenting: “That kind of behavior needs to stop, and we have offered our support and effort to help the Europeans in preventing these kinds of assassination attempts from taking place.” However, the European Union has been highly critical of President Trump’s decision to reimpose sanctions on the Islamic Republic, scrambling to save the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA). “We deeply regret the further re-imposition of sanctions by the United States, due to the latter’s withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA),” declared EU High Representative Federica Mogherini in a joint statement signed by British, French, and German ministers. “The JCPoA is a key element of the global nuclear non-proliferation architecture and of multilateral diplomacy, endorsed unanimously by the U.N. Security Council through Resolution 2231. It is crucial for the security of Europe, the region, and the entire world,” she said. Follow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomery.

{"global_context": "The party's cowardice has made it easy for the GOP to set the agenda and define the terms of debate. But it is unacceptable to maintain the status quo. These conditions call for dramatic solutions. Overhauling the layered complexities of our health care system or abolishing a federal agency may seem radical on its face, but that perception rests on divorcing the substance of the policies from the reasons they are necessary. Liberals do not seek to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement because they want to destroy agencies, but because they seek to end the harms perpetrated by this particular office. Americans are not seeking to overthrow the world, but to build a system that values and invests in our success and has mercy for our failures. In search of this, we have marched and organized and engaged in civil disobedience and protest. We handed a three-million-vote margin to the most progressive platform in decades in the previous election. Liberals do not seek to abolish ICE because they want to destroy agencies, but because they seek to end the harms perpetrated by this particular agency. This cowardice has enabled the Republican Party to set the agenda and define the parameters of discussion. The very same party that had a presidential candidate call for the outright eradication of three Cabinet-level agencies during a debate (though only remembering two) is somehow able to paint abolishing ICE as extreme. During that same campaign, every GOP candidate rejected a theoretical agreement in which they would receive a ten-to-one ratio of spending cuts to tax increases, in one of the most outrageous and public displays of fiscal innumeracy in American politics. The issues that animate their base — from guns and taxes to immigration and diversity — dominate our national dialogue even as majorities disagree with them, giving them outsized influence in what is meant to be a representative polity. Republicans do not even pretend to consider the lives and well-being of American citizens beyond their voters and donors, and, facing no rebuke and no consequence, they have internalized the idea that they never need to do so. SOPA Images via Getty Images Remedying this will require a radicalism heretofore unseen from Democratic leadership. It must be a radicalism of approach, investment and policy that centers the values, stories and lives of Democratic voters and their allies. They must, as Mario Cuomo once said, campaign in poetry and govern in prose. It is a radicalism that mentions the global ubiquity of paid maternity leave in the same breath as the global prevalence of universal healthcare systems. It is a radicalism that defends, not castigates, the righteous anger of Democratic representatives, like Maxine Waters of California and Frederica Wilson of Florida, when they are under attack. It is a radicalism that does not concede to the limited Republican notion of what the country has been, and instead challenges us to embrace what the country could be. It may seem easier to meekly preserve the Democratic legacy of the 20th century than it is to set the foundations for a new one in the 21st, but that is a false choice. Victory rests upon pushing forward an agenda designed for the problems of today while recognizing how we solved the ones of yesterday. It was not the moderation of the Democratic Party that salvaged the country from the Great Depression. It was not kindness that challenged fascism at home and abroad. It was not deference that ended de jure segregation and recognized black citizenship as American citizenship. It was radicalism. That same spirit is necessary to protect and expand our election systems, devastate white supremacy legislatively, reduce gun violence, set a floor for American poverty, develop the energy infrastructure of the future, equalize education, encompass all American citizens within the safety and power of representation and meet the challenges that have and will come with climate change. For the Democratic Party to survive and thrive, the days of campaigning in prose and governing in silence must end.

(Photo: Alex Wong, Getty Images) About an hour before the House Ways and Means Committee approved a sweeping tax overhaul Thursday, the Senate Finance Committee unveiled its own plan. Here are some of the differences between the two proposals, which are moving simultaneously through Congress. Brackets: The House has four: 12%, 25%, 35% and 39.6%. The Senate keeps seven but lowers them all: 10%, 12%, 22.5%, 25%, 32.5%, 35% and 38.5%. Child tax credit: Increases from $1,000 to $1,600 in House bill, $1,650 in Senate bill per child. Corporate cut: The House would lower the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% next year, and the Senate would do it starting in 2019. Estate tax: The House would double the current exemption to apply only to estates worth more than $10 million next year, and phase the tax out completely over six years; Senate would double the exemption next year but otherwise keep the tax. Major medical expenses: Deduction for expenses that exceed 10% of a taxpayer's income would be eliminated by the House; the Senate does not change this deduction. Mortgage interest: For new mortgages, only interest on the first $500,000 borrowed for a primary home would be deductible under the House bill, and interest on mortgages for second homes and home equity loans would no longer be deductible; the Senate would not not change the current limit, which is for the first $1 million borrowed, but would end the deduction for home equity loans. State and local taxes: The House bill would allow a deduction for up to $10,000 in property taxes, but end deductions for income or sales taxes; the Senate would eliminate all of them. Student loan interest: Deduction eliminated by the House bill; left intact by the Senate. Teacher purchases: Deduction for teachers who buy supplies for their classrooms would be eliminated by the House bill but left in place by the Senate.

Those measures will force Republicans to take a stand on whether to go along with the House Democratic majority’s attempt to publicly reprimand one of their own.

{"global_context": "An attorney for President Trump asked a New York state judge Tuesday to set aside a suit brought by a woman who claims Trump groped her a decade ago, saying that a trial in state court would improperly interfere with his duties as chief executive. Judge Jennifer Schecter heard arguments from Trump’s lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, and Mariann Wang, an attorney for Summer Zervos, a former contestant on Trump’s reality TV show “The Apprentice” who has alleged that Trump kissed her and touched her inappropriately during meetings in 2007 at Trump Tower and at the Beverly Hills Hotel. In her lawsuit, Zervos claims Trump defamed her last year when he labeled her and other women who accused him of sexual misconduct as liars. Kasowitz argued that Trump’s comments were protected by the 1st Amendment and that a state court doesn’t have the authority to hear the case during his presidency. Wang said the defamatory comments were not protected and a state court does have such authority. Zervos can’t sue Trump for sexual harassment because the time limit for such a case has expired. Pursuing the defamation case, however, could lead to airing of the underlying sexual harassment allegations. The suit could also jeopardize Trump in the way that a similar case by Paula Jones jeopardized then-President Clinton — by forcing him to answer questions under oath. Clinton’s false statements in Jones’ case provided the basis for the impeachment charges that were brought against him in 1998. Being required to testify under oath could be particularly dangerous for Trump, given his history of saying things that are untrue, said Naomi Mezey, a Georgetown University law professor. “For those people who are interested in this case as a path to impeachment, the chances of perjury in a Trump case are possibly greater than in a Clinton case,” Mezey said. “Testifying in a lawsuit takes a huge amount of discipline. If there’s one characteristic that seems absent from the Trump personality, it’s verbal discipline.” Zervos first spoke publicly about her contacts with Trump in October 2016, after an “Access Hollywood” videotape surfaced in which Trump spoke about being able to grab women by the genitals. Trump vigorously denied the accusations by Zervos and other women, repeatedly describing them as “fabrication” and “made-up stories and lies,” at one point threatening to sue the women. In a complaint filed in January, attorneys Gloria Allred and Wang said that Trump “used his national and international bully pulpit to make false factual statements to denigrate and verbally attack Ms. Zervos and the other women who publicly reported his sexual assaults,” causing “serious harm” to her reputation, honor and dignity. In addition to damages, the lawsuit seeks a retraction and apology by Trump. In briefs and before the court on Tuesday, Kasowitz argued that the case should be dismissed or at least stayed until Trump leaves office. The then-presidential candidate’s statements were political speech and statements of opinion protected by the 1st Amendment, he argued. In a twist of history, Kasowitz has invoked the same legal argument that attorneys for Clinton did 20 years ago, when he was accused of sexual harassment by Jones — that a sitting president is immune from lawsuits regarding his conduct before he took office. In 1997, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the chief executive is not shielded from responding to a civil suit regarding his private behavior. Trump’s lawyer argued that ruling should only apply to suits in federal court, not state courts. The Constitution makes clear that “federal law and the execution of federal law, for which the president is uniquely and 24/7 responsible, takes precedence over state law,” Kasowitz said. Wang said Kasowitz was making some “creative arguments.” “There is no case that says a federal official cannot be called to account in a state court,” she said. Three law professors who submitted friend-of-the-court briefs 20 years ago in the Clinton case and now in the Trump case have argued the same. “No one in our nation is above the law, not even our President,” Stephen Burbank of the University of Pennsylvania, Richard Parker of Harvard and Lucas Power of the University of Texas wrote in the brief filed earlier this year. Nothing in the Constitution “immunizes a sitting President from claims brought in state court based on allegations of unofficial conduct,” they wrote. Schecter did not issue a ruling, but did ask Zervos’ attorneys whether staying the case would be detrimental and if they would be “flexible” in accommodating the president’s schedule were a trial to go forward. Mezey, who teaches civil procedure and co-directs Georgetown’s Gender Justice Initiative, said she would be “stunned” if the judge found Trump to be immune. “All of the arguments that they made in Clinton v. Jones seem abundantly applicable to state court, and all of the accommodations that would be made in federal court could be made in state court as well,” Mezey said. Either way, the decision is likely to be appealed. “The implications are potentially huge, especially for someone like President Trump who appears to have a long line of potential plaintiffs like this one waiting in the wings,” Mezey said.

{"global_context": "By TOM LoBIANCO, ZEKE MILLER and JONATHAN LEMIRE WASHINGTON — Steve Bannon’s attorney relayed questions, in real time, to the White House during a House Intelligence Committee interview of the former Trump chief strategist, people familiar with the closed-door session told The Associated Press. As lawmakers probed Bannon’s time working for President Donald Trump, Bannon’s attorney Bill Burck was asking the White House counsel’s office by phone during the Tuesday session whether his client could answer the questions. He was told by that office not to discuss his work on the transition or in the White House. It’s unclear who Burck was communicating with in the White House. He is also representing top White House lawyer Don McGahn in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia. Tuesday’s conversations were confirmed by a White House official and a second person familiar with Bannon’s interview. They spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. On Wednesday, the AP also confirmed that Bannon will meet with Mueller’s investigators for an interview instead of appearing before a grand jury. A person familiar with that issue confirmed the interview and said Bannon is expected to cooperate with Mueller. The person was not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations. It’s unclear when the interview might occur. Burck didn’t respond to numerous phone messages left Tuesday and Wednesday. A spokeswoman for Bannon did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A spokesman for the special counsel’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bannon refused to answer a broad array of queries from the House Intelligence Committee about his time working for Trump, leading the Republican committee chairman to authorize a subpoena. Lawmakers were expecting a similar fight Wednesday with Trump’s White House as another senior aide, Rick Dearborn, was to appear for a private interview with the committee. The developments brought to the forefront questions about White House efforts to control what current and former aides tell Congress about their time in Trump’s inner circle, and whether Republicans on Capitol Hill would force the issue. It is unlikely the committee will face the same White House objections with Trump’s former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who is also being interviewed Wednesday. He never served in the White House. The interviews with Lewandowski and Dearborn were confirmed by two people familiar with the committee’s work who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to discuss the confidential interviews. The congressional subpoena for Bannon came after the former far-right media executive and recently scorned Trump adviser received a grand jury subpoena issued by Mueller. That subpoena, first reported by The New York Times, appeared to be a negotiating tactic that then prompted Bannon to agree to a sit-down with Mueller’s prosecutors rather than appearing before the grand jury. Bannon confirmed that he had received the subpoena from Mueller during his House Intelligence Committee interview, according to a person who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the person wasn’t authorized to publicly discuss Bannon’s interactions with Mueller. Lawmakers questioned Bannon as part of their investigation into Russian election inference and sought answers about Trump’s thinking when he fired FBI Director James Comey. But Bannon refused to answer questions about that crucial period, and as a result, the chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., issued the subpoena, spokesman Jack Langer said. A White House official said the White House counsel’s office had a conversation last week with committee counsel about Bannon’s testimony and was told the questions were expected to be about the campaign. The official said the White House offered to send an attorney to attend the interview and was told the move wasn’t necessary. But when the lawmaker’s questions moved to Bannon’s time in the White House, Bannon’s lawyer got on the phone with the counsel’s office. Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the committee’s top Democrat, said Bannon’s refusal to answer questions from the panel “can’t stand” and went far beyond other witnesses who have declined to answer specific questions. He said the committee expects to have Bannon return for more questioning. “This was effectively a gag order by the White House preventing this witness from answering almost any question concerning his time in the administration and many questions even after he left the administration,” Schiff said. Trump press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, “As with all congressional inquiries touching upon the White House, Congress must consult with the White House prior to obtaining confidential material. This is part of a judicially recognized process that goes back decades.” ___ Lemire reported from New York.

{"global_context": "The two Turkish men shuffled into the courtroom, their closely cropped hair, clean shaven faces and chubby waistlines hardly the look of fearsome fighters of the Islamic State. Appearing in court for the first time since being arrested in August on charges of belonging to that group, they professed their innocence, telling the judge they were simply plumbers who migrated to Iraq from Turkey looking for work. After an 18-minute trial, they were sentenced to death by hanging. The men are among hundreds of foreigners detained in Iraq on terrorism charges after the toppling of the Islamic State's self-declared caliphate. The defendants - men, women and children hailing from Asia, Europe and Africa - are coursing their way through Iraq's criminal justice system, receiving harsh sentences in rapid-fire trials. The trials and capital sentences are presenting foreign governments with a moral and political dilemma. Do they object to the Iraqi trials and claim their citizens, who could threaten their home countries and radicalize others if repatriated? Or should Iraqi courts be allowed to determine the defendants' fate in trials that human rights groups and the United Nations say are deeply flawed? The issue has taken on a new urgency as major combat against the Islamic State ended this month. Iraq has fast-tracked executions under the year-old orders of Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, aiming to \"give comfort to the families\" of Islamic State's victims. Iraq's justice ministry has disclosed 194 terrorism-related executions since 2016, including at least 27 foreigners from other Arab countries, according to a review of ministry news releases. Last week, the ministry said it had executed another 38 prisoners on terrorism-related charges, but it did not specify their nationalities, prompting a rebuke by the United Nations human rights office. At least one of those executed had Swedish citizenship, researchers into human rights and terrorism said. Up to 6,000 more are on death row and their nationalities have not been disclosed, according to the United Nations. Many more suspected militants are in custody, including at least four Europeans. European countries have given little indication that they want to claim their citizens. In a statement, Turkey's foreign ministry said it is aware of their citizens being detained in Iraq for allegedly joining the Islamic State. \"We are in touch with the Iraqi authorities in terms of finding out their whereabouts and ensuring their repatriation,\" the statement said. The United Nations said last month that Iraq does not have jurisdiction to try Islamic State atrocities and that Iraqi investigators, prosecutors and judges do not have the capability to ensure due process. It urged Iraq to turn to the International Criminal Court for such cases, especially ones dealing with the attempted genocide of minority groups like the Yazidis whose reintegration into Iraqi society largely depends on the accurate prosecution of crimes committed against them. Iraq's massive dragnet is ensnaring scores of innocent people, while rushed investigations and trials are failing to distinguish between Iraqis who embraced the Islamic State and others who cooperated with the group out of fear or coercion, human rights groups and the United Nations said. The lack of due process could imperil national reconciliation by enshrining a cycle of revenge in Iraq's courts, these groups said. This dynamic raises the possibility of continued sectarian conflict between Shiites that dominate the government and legal system and Sunnis who account for nearly all those accused of terrorism.

(Ahmad Al-Rubaye / AFP/Getty Images) (Ahmad Al-Rubaye / AFP/Getty Images) But Abdulsattar Bayraqdar, a senior Iraqi federal judge, bristled at the criticism, saying his country's judges and lawyers have sacrificed their lives to guarantee fair trials and hold terrorists accountable. He said since 2003, at least 60 judges and more than 160 investigators and court employees have been killed in terrorist attacks stemming from their work. As for foreigners affiliated with the Islamic State, Bayraqdar said crimes committed by extremists on Iraq's soil must be prosecuted in Iraq, and it is under no legal obligation to hand over suspects or convicts to other countries. \"But those who are acquitted are being handed over to their countries,\" he said. 'Judge with justice' The single courtroom where terrorism trials are heard is spartan. An imposing wooden cage sits in the middle of the room. From behind the bars, defendants face a panel of three judges on a high bench. Behind the cage are three rows of benches, typically occupied by lawyers. Defendants' families are not allowed in the room. The walls are bare, except for a small banner above the judge's heads imprinted with a partial Koranic verse: \"When you judge between people, judge with justice.\" Last week, after court clerks finally located a Turkish language interpreter, the Turkish defendants were brought in wearing faded brown jumpsuits. The lead judge, Suhail Abdullah, eyed their charge sheet, confirming their identities: Ramadan Hassan, 24, and Talat Yakout, 40. The judge advised them they were charged under Iraq's anti-terrorism law with joining the Islamic State and said they would be provided a lawyer at the expense of the state. A lawyer from the audience stood up and accepted papers from the bailiff, hurriedly reviewing them as Abdullah recounted how the men had been taken into custody. They had been arrested by soldiers while trying to flee Tal Afar, a western city near the border with Syria. They allegedly tried to blend in with hundreds of families fleeing the city as Iraqi forces stormed it to evict Islamic State militants. Next, reading from what he said was their confession to investigators, the judge described Hassan and Yakout as small-time operatives for the Islamic State when they entered Iraq illegally in February 2014. He said they had admitted to coming to Iraq to fight. The defendants, whispering to their interpreter, denied the charge. They said they had come to Iraq to make money. They argued they had never engaged in combat for the militant group. \"But that's your testimony, right here,\" the judge shot back. \"I said that after being tortured,\" Hassan said. \"I came to Tal Afar to only work as a plumber.\" \"Welcome, welcome,\" Abdullah said sarcastically. \"You expect me to believe you came to Tal Afar while it was occupied by Islamic State to work as a plumber?\" Yakout offered a similar defense, pointing to their surrender to the Iraqi army as evidence of their innocence. \"Of course you surrendered, because time had run out,\" the judge said.

{"global_context": "Setting up an explosive general election battle, a Donald Trump-backed Republican and a Bernie Sanders-endorsed insurgent Democrat will face off to be the next governor of Florida following primaries Tuesday, according to an NBC News projection. Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. WASHINGTON — Setting up an explosive general election battle, a Donald Trump-backed Republican and a Bernie Sanders-endorsed insurgent Democrat who prevailed in an upset will face off in the Florida governor race following primaries Tuesday night, NBC News projects. In a surprise win, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, a black progressive who never led in a major poll, edged out former Rep. Gwen Graham, the politically moderate daughter of popular former governor and senator Bob Graham, in the Democratic primary. Gillum had 34.2 percent, or 510,450 votes, to Graham's 31.4 percent, or 468,448 votes, with 96 percent of precincts reporting. For Republicans, Rep. Ron DeSantis easily defeated state Agriculture Secretary Adam Putnam, thanks to a crucial early endorsement from Trump that gave him a major boost. DeSantis captured 56.5 percent, or 908,443 votes, to Putnam's 36.5 percent, or 587,579 votes, with 97 percent of precincts reporting. The marquee governor's contest between two 39 year olds in the key swing state is already the most expensive in history, with more than $120 million spent, and both parties will prioritize it November. At DeSantis' watch party in Orlando, when his victory was announced, the crowd wasn't chanting for the candidate — it was \"Trump! Trump! Trump!\" The president tweeted it was a \"fantastic win\" for DeSantis. For their part, Democrats had been preparing to support Graham in November. They'll now have to scramble to get behind Gillum, who has a compelling biography and the support of mega donors Tom Steyer and George Soros, but legal baggage thanks to an FBI investigation into his allies. \"What has made Andrew's campaign so powerful is that he’s not just working hard to win an election, he has laid out a vision for a new course for the state of Florida and our country,\" said Sanders. \"That's what the political revolution is all about and Andrew Gillum is helping to lead it.\" Gillum breaks a dry spell for progressive gubernatorial candidates, after Democratic primary voters in other swing states like Michigan and Wisconsin opted for more establishment-friendly nominees. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the left-wing congressional candidate in New York, hailed the victory. Gillum, the son of a construction worker and school bus driver, was the first person in his family to go to college and the youngest person ever elected to the Tallahassee City Commission. In the FBI probe, he has denied any wrongdoing and is not directly implicated, but the investigation into alleged pay-for-play schemes in Tallahassee city government officials is sure to dog the campaign. Andrew Gillum holds his son Jackson as he addresses his supporters after winning the Democrat primary for governor in Tallahassee, Fla on Aug. 28, 2018. Steve Cannon / AP DeSantis' opening shot at Gillum, however, took a difference tact. Gillum is \"way, way too liberal for the state of Florida,\" DeSantis told NBC News Tuesday night. \"I think it's gonna be a great contrast and we’ll take it to him.\" DeSantis said he spoke by phone to Trump, who congratulated him on running \"a hell of a race.\" DeSantis ran as a close Trump ally, attracting national attention for a comical ad that went viral in which he taught young children to say \"Make America Great Again.\" Putnam's potential in the Florida GOP was once seen as limitless, but that was before Trump took over the Republican Party and loyalty to the president — whom DeSantis often defends on Fox News — became a key litmus test for GOP voters. Trump-backed candidates have won nearly all their primaries this year, but the president had a miss last week in Wyoming after his endorsement failed to deliver the gubernatorial nomination to donor Foster Friess. Outgoing GOP Florida Gov. Rick Scott is running for Senate and easily won his primary Tuesday night against token opposition. He'll face off against Democrat Sen. Bill Nelson in November in a race that is expected to cost millions and could determine the balance of power in the Senate. Despite the outcome at the top of the ticket, it was not a good night for other insurgent Democrats in Florida. Alan Grayson, the controversial liberal firebrand, failed in his congressional comeback bid, while a primary challenger backed by Ocasio-Cortez got crushed 86 percent to 14 percent by a more moderate incumbent. And Donna Shalala, Bill Clinton's former health secretary, won her open-seat primary. Alex Seitz-Wald reported from Washington and Ali Vitali from Orlando, Fla.

Hope Hicks, one of President Trump's closest aides since before the start of the billionaire businessman's quest for the presidency, has officially been tapped as White House communications director, officials confirmed Tuesday. Hicks had been named to the post on an interim basis in August, when Anthony Scaramucci left the job after his brief and tumultuous tenure. Hicks, 28, is an ardent loyalist to the president who was one of the first staffers on the Trump campaign. She also worked for The Trump Organization where she worked on several ventures including projects for Ivanka Trump, senior White House adviser and Trump’s daughter. \"[Hicks] has the credibility, leadership and respect from everyone in the West Wing. And in a very short order has helped the communications operation enormously,\" a senior White House official told Fox News. The Trump White House now has three women in major roles in the communication and press shops. Along with Hicks, Sarah Sanders is press secretary and Stephanie Grisham is communications director for first lady Melania Trump. Last week on ABC’s “The View,” Sanders said Trump was \"empowering\" women by placing them in top brass roles at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. \"We have never had a female press secretary and a female communications director [at the same time], ever, in the history of the White House -- and we do in this one,” Sanders said. Hicks initially was reluctant to take the communications director role but is a favorite aide to the president and first family and has the respect of White House staff. In August, following Hicks' selection to run the communications shop on an interim basis, Ivanka Trump seemed to hint that the position could be more permanent. “Congratulations to my talented friend & colleague Hope Hicks on being named WH Communications Director.

Alleged intellectual property theft by China has been an issue of particular concern to Silicon Valley.

Jeremy Hunt has called on Boris Johnson not to be a “coward” by avoiding a live TV debate with him this week as the Tory leadership race turned personal. Hunt suggested dodging a Sky News head-to-head would risk his rival “slinking through the back door” of Number 10 as Johnson remained under pressure to explain why police were called to the home he shares with partner Carrie Symonds, Foreign Secretary Hunt has previously attacked Johnson over reports he was “bottling” a live TV debate before postal ballots are returned. In his column for the Daily Telegraph, Johnson attempted to switch attention back to political rather than personal issues as he repeated his determination to deliver Brexit by Halloween. Stepping up pressure on his rival, Hunt insisted that while he has no interest in debating Johnson’s private life, he wants to challenge him on television over his commitment to taking the UK out of the EU by the end of October. In an article in The Times, Hunt said: “A new prime minister needs the legitimacy of having made his arguments publicly and having them subjected to scrutiny. “Only then can you walk through the front door of No 10 with your head held high instead of slinking through the back door, which is what Boris appears to want.” He added: “Don’t be a coward Boris, man up and show the nation you can cope with the intense scrutiny the most difficult job in the country will involve.” Hunt said on Sunday that he thought any candidate for prime minister “should answer questions on everything”. Meanwhile, Johnson wrote in the Telegraph: “We must leave the EU on Oct 31 come what may. It will honour the referendum result, it will focus the minds of EU negotiators.” He added: “It is absolutely vital that we keep our eyes on the prize. It has been a long and parching march – but the oasis is finally in sight. “We are just over four months away from the date on which, by law, we must leave the EU; and this time we are not going to bottle it. We are not going to fail. “This time we are not going to shrink in fear from the exit, as we have on the last two occasions.” This is what I was writing about this morning. It's rubbish. Vacuous rubbish. You can't just bang on about \"mettle\" and \"creativity\". You have to set out a plan. An actual plan. https://t.co/LrdUKsUAIh — (((Dan Hodges))) (@DPJHodges) June 23, 2019 Earlier, Hunt took a swipe at his competitor for Downing Street after Johnson repeatedly refused to reveal what led to the police involvement in the early hours of Friday morning. Hunt told Sky News: “I think someone who wants to be prime minister should answer questions on everything. “But I’m not going to comment on issues of character because … I am sure you and I have got things, that, you know, we would be embarrassed if they came out. “I just think it’s irrelevant given the gravity of the situation. I am not going to comment on Boris’s personal life. That’s for others to make their judgments on.” The Foreign Secretary insisted his predecessor in the Cabinet role was trying to avoid scrutiny in the battle for Number 10. “What Boris needs to do is engage properly in this leadership debate. “This is an audition to be the prime minister of the United Kingdom and Boris needs to show that he is prepared to answer difficult questions.” Hunt supporter and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox signalled it was better to be clear about what had happened. Dr Fox told BBC1’s The Andrew Marr Show: “I think it is always easier to just give an explanation.” He added: “It is inevitable there is a focus on private lives. That does not concern me. What I am concerned about are the issues.” Johnson repeatedly refused to explain to Tory grassroots at a Saturday hustings what went on at the south London flat in the early hours of Friday morning, saying the party faithful did not want “to hear about that kind of thing”. Johnson’s campaign for Number 10 was rocked by the revelations that officers were called to the home he shares with partner Symonds by a neighbour who claimed to have been “frightened and concerned” after hearing shouting, “a loud scream” and banging coming from the property. A poll carried out after the reports emerged suggested Johnson’s support among Tory voters had dropped by more than half while among the general electorate it indicated he had slipped into second place behind rival Hunt. PA Wire/PA Images At the hustings, moderator Iain Dale drew heckles from some in the crowd when he asked Johnson whether a person’s private life had any bearing on someone’s ability to discharge the office of prime minister. “Don’t boo the great man,” Johnson said, but Dale suggested he was “completely avoiding” the question. On Saturday night, the neighbour who rang the Metropolitan Police went public after suggestions that his recording of the row had been leaked to The Guardian with political intent. Tom Penn said the allegations were “bizarre and fictitious”, explaining in a statement to the paper that he dialled 999 after hearing shouting coming from his neighbour’s flat. “It was loud enough and angry enough that I felt frightened and concerned for the welfare of those involved, so I went inside my own home, closed the door, and pressed record on the voice memos app on my phone,” the 29-year-old playwright said. “After a loud scream and banging, followed by silence, I ran upstairs, and with my wife agreed that we should check on our neighbours. “I knocked three times at their front door, but there was no response.

Pelosi said Tuesday that Democrats would take action to “end the Trump Shutdown” by passing legislation Thursday to reopen government. “We are giving the Republicans the opportunity to take yes for an answer,” she wrote in a letter to colleagues. “Senate Republicans have already supported this legislation, and if they reject it now, they will be fully complicit in chaos and destruction of the President’s third shutdown of his term.” The White House invitation came Tuesday after House Democrats released their plan to re-open the government without approving money for a border wall — unveiling two bills to fund shuttered government agencies and put hundreds of thousands of federal workers back on the job. They planned to pass them as soon as the new Congress convenes Thursday. Responding to the Democratic plan, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders late Tuesday night called it a “non-starter” and said it won’t re-open the government “because it fails to secure the border and puts the needs of other countries above the needs of our own citizens.” Trump spent the weekend saying Democrats should return to Washington to negotiate, firing off Twitter taunts. After aides suggested there would not necessarily be a traditional wall as Trump had described since his presidential campaign, Trump stated that he really still wanted to build a border wall. On Tuesday morning, after tweeting a New Year’s message to “EVERYONE INCLUDING THE HATERS AND THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA,” Trump tweeted: “The Democrats, much as I suspected, have allocated no money for a new Wall. So imaginative! The problem is, without a Wall there can be no real Border Security.” But he seemed to shift tactics later in the day, appealing to Pelosi. “Border Security and the Wall ‘thing’ and Shutdown is not where Nancy Pelosi wanted to start her tenure as Speaker! Let’s make a deal?” he tweeted. Whether the Republican-led Senate would consider the Democratic bills — or if Trump would sign either into law — was unclear. McConnell spokesman Donald Stewart said Senate Republicans would not take action without Trump’s backing. “It’s simple: The Senate is not going to send something to the president that he won’t sign,” Stewart said. Even if only symbolic, the passage of the bills in the House would put fresh pressure on the president. At the same time, administration officials said Trump was in no rush for a resolution to the impasse. Trump believes he has public opinion on his side and, at very least, his base of supporters behind him, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The Democratic package to end the shutdown would include one bill to temporarily fund the Department of Homeland Security at current levels — with $1.3 billion for border security, far less than the $5 billion Trump has said he wants for the wall — through Feb. 8 as talks continued. It would also include another measure to fund the departments of Agriculture, Interior, Housing and Urban Development and others closed by the partial shutdown. It would provide money through the remainder of the fiscal year, to Sept. 30. Associated Press writer Kevin Freking contributed to this report.

{"global_context": "President Trump had a grand strategy for solving the border crisis long before his political opponents even acknowledged that the crisis exists, and that strategy is really starting to take shape now. After successfully persuading Mexico to assist the U.S. government in securing the border, President Trump recently announced that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will begin a nationwide crackdown to remove millions of illegal aliens who are subject to deportation orders unless Democrats in Congress agree to fix the loopholes in our asylum laws that are largely responsible for the humanitarian and national security crisis on the southern border. “[Illegal immigrants] will be removed as fast as they come in,” he pledged. “Mexico, using their strong immigration laws, is doing a very good job of stopping people long before they get to our Southern Border.” The president also revealed that Guatemala is getting ready to sign “a Safe-Third [Country] Agreement,” which will require migrants who pass through Guatemala to apply for asylum there rather than at the U.S. border. President Trump’s critics variously claim that he has no coherent strategy for solving the illegal immigration crisis, or else that he “manufactured” the crisis himself. The Democrats, in particular, are obsessed with depicting his immigration policies as either cruel or ineffective, depending on the context. Meanwhile Hispanic law enforcement officers, Border Patrol officials, and activists have done everything in their power to shed light on the trafficking issue and its correlation to the influx of illegal immigrants, especially among Hispanic women and children. In fact, right up until the new agreement with Mexico was announced, the President’s political opponents and the mainstream media were confidently predicting that his threat to implement a 5 percent tariff on all Mexican goods would “backfire spectacularly.” Since when is it more important to focus on an increase in the price of imported vehicles and vegetables as opposed to human life and America’s national security? As usual, however, Donald Trump’s critics were completely wrong. In response to President Trump’s pressure, the Mexican government has agreed to take significant actions to prevent illegal immigration, such as deploying 6,000 national guard soldiers and allowing asylum-seekers to remain in Mexico while their claims are processed by U.S. authorities. The immigration deal with Mexico was a key part of Donald Trump’s strategy, and a necessary precursor to the large-scale deportation initiative that he just announced. With congressional Democrats still obstructing the president’s efforts to build the border wall and fix the loopholes in America’s immigration laws, any attempt to deport millions of illegal aliens would be futile without Mexico’s willingness to help plug the holes in our porous border. Sadly, Mexico’s assistance wouldn’t even be necessary if Congress would untie the president’s hands by providing the legal and financial resources to adequately protect American communities. What many in Congress and the media fail to understand is that these hardline policies will, in fact, act as a deterrent to many individuals who would otherwise be exploited during the process of coming to the U.S. illegally. “The only ones who won’t do anything are the Democrats in Congress,” Trump pointed out, contrasting their partisan obstructionism with Mexico’s cooperativeness. “They must vote to get rid of the loopholes, and fix asylum! If so, Border Crisis will end quickly!” President Trump is right — ever since he took office, the Democrat Party has done everything in its power to undermine efforts to secure the U.S.-Mexico border. To make matters worse, some Democrats are pretending that the crisis doesn’t exist at all, arguing that Americans should simply ignore the fact that millions of migrants are entering the country illegally while turning a blind eye to the staggering numbers of Hispanics being trafficked.

As pension and budget woes rise, there are ways to help teachers save for retirement Why Pelosi and the Democrats hesitate on impeaching Trump Doing nothing, however, is no longer an option. Our own immigration officials have warned that their resources are being completely overwhelmed by the surge of illegal immigrants — last month alone, Border Patrol apprehended more than 132,000 illegal immigrants at the southern border, far more than our existing detention facilities can safely accommodate. After years of apathetic inactivity, however, the federal government is finally taking concrete steps to stop illegal immigration under President Trump’s leadership. The president stoically faced down congressional opposition in order to secure the resources needed to start building the border wall, and followed that victory up by convincing the government of Mexico to pick up some of the slack left by obstructionist Democrats in the U.S. Congress. Now, he’s preparing to execute the next phase of his strategy by directing ICE to enforce the millions of deportation orders that have gone unheeded for years, bringing us yet another step closer to finally solving the illegal immigration crisis and letting the whole world know that human trafficking and the exploitation of America’s immigration system will no longer be tolerated.

{"global_context": "The hottest congressional race in Los Angeles County just got hotter. Among Democrats hoping to emerge as the challenger to Republican Rep. Steve Knight of Palmdale, experienced candidate Bryan Caforio had long been considered the front-runner. But new campaign fundraising reports show Katie Hill, a 30-year-old first-time candidate, has leapfrogged Caforio in contributions — and brought in more money even than Knight in the fourth quarter of 2017. Hill campaign manager Zack Czajkowski said the end-of-year fund-raising figures signal a change in the contest in House District 25, which covers parts of the San Fernando, Simi, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys. “I think Katie is the best-positioned candidate to beat Steve Knight in November,” Czajkowski said Thursday in a phone interview. Knight, who is in his second term in Congress after a career in law enforcement and the California Legislature, is one of the Republican incumbents being targeted for defeat by Democrats in 2018 after their districts favored Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. The race is rated a “tossup” by the Cook Political Report, while Roll Call lists it among races that “lean Republican.” With Knight all but certain to finish in the top two in the June 5 primary and qualify for the Nov. 6 ballot, the question is which of a handful of Democrats will join him: Caforio, an attorney who lost to Knight by 6.2 percentage points in the 2016 general election; Hill, who grew up in the district who until recently ran the non-profit People Assisting the Homeless (PATH); Jess Phoenix, a geologist and founder of the environmental research and education non-profit Blueprint Earth; Diedra Greenaway, a Northridge East Neighborhood Council board member and L.A. city budget advocate; or Steve McVarish, an attorney and former teacher’s union leader. In fundraising details submitted to the Federal Election Commission — one traditional indicator of candidates’ strength — Knight maintained his lead in total contributions with $815,527 through Dec. 31. Hill ($686,641) jumped over Caforio ($661,751) into second, with Phoenix ($284,217) next and Greenaway and McVarish far back. Related Articles The new political normal?

Steve Knight uninjured when train carrying GOP House members hits truck Hill had been third behind Knight and Caforio in the end-of-September fundraising reports but surged in the last three months of the year, bringing in $252,342 in that period, compared to $240,244 for Knight, $211,496 for Caforio and $157,750 for Phoenix. Hill also topped Caforio in cash on hand at the end of December, $381,848 to $377,203, but Knight had a comfortable lead in that column with $794,747. Knight campaign consultant Matt Rexroad emphasized the incumbent’s spending power and said: “In June, I would expect all of our opponents to be at zero [cash on hand]. We will not be.” For Hill’s campaign, it was another reason to crow a day after it said its own polling Jan. 9-15 showed that if the general election were held now, Hill would beat Knight by 4 percentage points but Caforio would lose to Knight by 5. Caforio did have some things to brag about this week. He took a big step toward an endorsement by the California Democratic Party last Saturday when he received more than 70 percent of votes by central and local party delegates at a “pre-endorsement conference.” His campaign also pointed to endorsements from many Democratic clubs in District 25 as evidence that the district “has unified behind Democrat Bryan Caforio.” The fundraising figures showing Hill and Caforio far ahead among Democrats will disappoint Phoenix’s avid following on social media, where the woman sometimes known as “Volcano Jess” has more than 40,000 Twitter followers. (Knight has 4,500, Hill 3,800, Caforio 2,200.) But Phoenix found some encouragement in the contribution figures. In a statement, her campaign pointed to its $44.50 average contribution (Hill’s average is $103) as proof she is “a true candidate of the people.” And it said it finished the year strongly, raising $129,005 in December, including $102,143 in the last 10 days of 2017, “positioning the campaign as a strong contender in 2018.”.

{"global_context": "By ELLEN KNICKMEYER | Associated Press WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Tuesday came out with new rules scaling back Obama-era constraints on coal-fired power plants, striking at one of the former administration’s legacy programs to rein in climate-changing fossil-fuel emissions. The Environmental Protection Agency called the Obama-era regulations on coal power plants “overly prescriptive and burdensome.” The Trump administration plan broadly increases the leeway given states to decide how and how much to regulate coal power plants. The EPA says it “empowers states, promotes energy independence, and facilitates economic growth and job creation.” Combined with the EPA’s proposal earlier this month to ease mileage requirements for vehicles, the move may actually increase the country’s climate-changing emissions, according to some former top EPA officials, environmental groups, and other opponents. The Natural Resources Defense Council called the replacement proposal Trump’s “Dirty Power Plan.” Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey cited this summer’s wildfires and increasing droughts and coastal flooding as evidence that man-made climate change from burning coal and other fossil fuels is already well upon the United States. “Once again, this administration is choosing polluters’ profits over public health and safety,” he said. Scientists say that without extensive study they cannot directly link a single weather event to climate change, but climate change is responsible for more intense and more frequent extreme events such as storms, droughts, floods and wildfires. In a statement, Republican Sen. John Barrasso from the coal state of Wyoming welcomed the overhaul of the Obama administration’s 2015 regulations, called the Clean Power Plan. The new proposal establishes emission guidelines for states to use when developing any plans to limit climate-changing emissions from power plants. Critics say the new plan would allow utilities to run older, dirtier power plants more often and extend the plants’ overall operating life, undercutting potential environmental benefits. President Donald Trump is expected to promote the new plan at an appearance in West Virginia on Tuesday. Trump has already vowed to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement as he pushes to revive the coal industry. The Obama administration had worked to nudge the country’s power producers to natural gas, wind and solar power, and other less-polluting power sources. Trump also has directed Energy Secretary Rick Perry to take steps to bolster struggling coal-fired and nuclear power plants to keep them open, warning that impending retirements of “fuel-secure” power plants that rely on coal and nuclear power are harming the nation’s power grid and reducing its resilience. Obama’s plan was designed to cut U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The rule dictated specific emission targets for states based on power-plant emissions and gave officials broad latitude to decide how to achieve reductions. The Supreme Court put the plan on hold in 2016 following a legal challenge by industry and coal-friendly states, an order that remains in effect. Even so, the Obama plan has been a factor in a wave of retirements of coal-fired plants, which also are being squeezed by lower costs for natural gas and renewable power and state mandates that promote energy conservation. Trump has vowed to end what Republicans call a “war on coal” waged by Obama. “They are continuing to play to their base and following industry’s lead,” Gina McCarthy, EPA administrator when the Obama plan was developed, said of the Trump administration and its new acting administrator, Andrew Wheeler, a former coal industry lobbyist. “This is all about coal at all costs.” Michelle Bloodworth, president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, a trade group that represents coal producers, called the new rule a marked departure from the “gross overreach” of the Obama administration and said it should prevent a host of premature coal-plant retirements. “We agree with those policymakers who have become increasingly concerned that coal retirements are a threat to grid resilience and national security,” she said. Tuesday’s move opens a public-comment period on the proposal before any final administration action. Associated Press writer Matthew Daly contributed to this report.

{"global_context": "Five months after the so-called Battle of Berkeley began, Alameda County prosecutors are pressing charges against those accused of causing the violent clashes between far-right and far-left demonstrators. The latest charged were filed this week against Kyle Chapman, an extreme-right organizer who has said on social media that he’s planning to hold other rallies later this month. Chapman, 41, was seen on video swinging a heavy wooden rod at counter-demonstrators during a March 4 demonstration in Berkeley in support of President Trump. The commercial diver from Daly City is accused of felony possession of a “leaded cane/billy” — described in police detectives’ statements as a tape-wrapped stick, adorned with two stickers of the U.S. flag. He has a history of weapons-related charges. The complaint alleges that, if he is convicted, this would be Chapman’s third strike under California’s three-strikes law, which enhances penalties for multiple convictions. He has a 2009 burglary conviction for which he served time in prison. He was one of hundreds of demonstrators who clashed and brawled on the streets of Berkeley. In a post to his Facebook page, Chapman declared that he was “ready to go to jail for this movement,” taunting the district attorney and cursing the “trumped up bogus charges. I’m speaking in Boston! Catch me if you can punk!” There is a “free-speech” rally planned in Boston on Saturday that is expected to attract activists on the far-right and left. Assistant Dist. Atty. Teresa Dresnick said the case against Chapman is unrelated to his role in rallies scheduled Aug. 26 at a national park in San Francisco and Aug. 27 at a city park in Berkeley. “It’s related to what happened on March 4. There has been an enormous amount of evidence for us to meticulously and methodically review,” Dresnick said Friday. Court files show felony charges have been filed against two others related to the demonstrations. Eric Clanton, 48, is charged with four counts of assault with a deadly weapon. Clanton, a former community college professor affiliated with the anarchist movement, has been arraigned on charges of hitting multiple people on the head with a bicycle lock. A third rally participant, Berkeley resident and Trump supporter Robert Peete, 53, is charged with assault with a deadly weapon, wearing a mask and possession of a billy stick, in this case an ax handle. According to a probable cause statement, Peete allegedly hit a counter-protester with the weapon during an April 15 rally, knocking the unknown victim to the ground. Misdemeanor charges are pending against seven other individuals. Dockets show most of the cases were filed in late July and early August. The demonstrations and protests have resulted in dozens of reported injuries and scores of arrests, including 23 people at an April rally held after conservative commentator Ann Coulter canceled an appearance at the college. Most of those individuals have not been charged. Dresnick said she did not know if further charges were pending. The image of Chapman — bearing a plywood shield, his face covered by a gas mask and helmet as he lunged at demonstrators with his raised stick — earned him viral fame among the radical right. Chapman has become a well-known figure in the far-right world, vowing violent responses to anti-fascists, anarchists and other demonstrators who turn out in opposition to white nationalist and self-proclaimed patriot rallies.

Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) says President Donald Trump’s attacks against the press are reminiscent of similar tactics employed by Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. During his first year in office, Trump has repeatedly blasted the nation’s news media as “fake” and dishonest, even going so far as to call it “the enemy of the American people” last year. Appearing on ABC’s “This Week” program on Sunday, Flake, a frequent critic of the president, said he planned to give a speech Wednesday about the president’s behavior. “When you reflexively refer to the press as the enemy of the people or fake news, that has real damage,” Flake will say in the speech, according to an excerpt provided to ABC. “It has real damage to our standing in the world.

Shame!” outside the courthouse. Ashen-faced and wearing a muted plaid sport coat, Hunter spoke quietly in court, saying only “not guilty” when asked to enter a plea by U.S. Magistrate Judge William Gallo. “The charges against me are politically motivated and without merit,” Hunter said in a letter to Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan that was forwarded to Reuters after the hearing. “I intend to fight them fully.” In the letter, dated Thursday, Hunter asked Ryan to remove him from his congressional committee assignments, an action Ryan had already said he was planning to take. While he and Margaret Hunter were inside the courthouse being fingerprinted, protesters outside changed their chant to “Lock him up!,” a nod to the Trump campaign’s rallying cry to imprison Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, who was investigated by the FBI for use of a private email server but never charged. The indictment against Hunter and his wife on Tuesday came the same day that Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, was found guilty of tax and bank fraud, and former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to crimes including tax evasion, bank fraud and campaign finance violations. The highly detailed indictment by a grand jury in San Diego alleged that the Hunters used campaign accounts to pay for their children’s private school tuition, lavish travel including a trip to Italy and restaurant meals that frequently cost hundreds of dollars. Congressman Duncan Hunter (R-CA) arrives for his arraignment at federal court in San Diego, California, U.S. August 23, 2018. REUTERS/Mike Blake It also alleges the Hunters lied about how the money was spent, with the couple saying it went to charity or campaign events when prosecutors said it was really used for groceries, restaurant meals and clothing. “The Hunters’ improper use of campaign funds for personal expenses occurred despite numerous warnings about the prohibition against using campaign funds for personal expenses and repeated inquiries from Duncan Hunter’s campaign treasurer about questionable purchases,” U.S. attorney Adam Braverman, an interim Trump administration appointee, said in a news release on Tuesday. TARGET LIST Hunter, whose father, Duncan Hunter, Sr., also served in Congress, represents conservative portions of San Diego and Riverside counties in a seat that is generally considered safe for Republicans. But the Hunters’ legal woes could put the seat in play, according to political analysts. California is key to Democrats’ efforts to wrest control of the U.S. House of Representatives from Trump’s Republicans. The Democratic Party added Hunter’s district to its list of targets months ago, and on Wednesday, election handicappers at the Cook Political Report assessed the district as merely “leaning” Republican, a change from its prior rating of “solid Republican.” The campaign of his Democratic opponent, Ammar Campa-Najjar, has already referenced the case in several news releases this week, and Campa-Najjar was on hand at the courthouse on Thursday, briefly addressing reporters and protesters. The area will be difficult to pry away from Republican control, but in a sign of the Democrats’ determination, top strategist Joe Trippi - whose advice helped Democrat Doug Jones defeat Republican Roy Moore in a U.S. Senate race in deep-red Alabama last year, signed on last month to lead Campa-Najjar’s campaign. Trippi told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday he expects the criminal case against Hunter will lead more voters to support Campa-Najjar. “This is something that is going to hang over him for a long time,” he said, referring to Hunter. “And with that I think a lot more people will be taking a closer look at Ammar.” Slideshow (7 Images).

{"global_context": "The president may have learned from Nixon and his Saturday Night Massacre that purges are best done slowly. There are certainly disturbing parallels. A president lashing out at an investigation into his office. Questions of whether raw power can be abused to subvert justice. But so far, there is an important difference. Nixon’s massacre was propelled by one brazen goal: firing the prosecutor investigating him. It was a corrupt objective that tainted the entire effort, and the White House admitted it. On that infamous evening, in fact, Ron Ziegler, Nixon’s White House press secretary, claimed that the “office of the Watergate special prosecution force has been abolished.” It had not. The legal history is instructive. The rank-and-file prosecutors who worked for that office showed that it was not abolished; within a few days they were back in court, urging a judge to grant subpoenas and a measure to hold the president in contempt. Public and congressional pressure led to the appointment of another special prosecutor. And that’s not all. On a separate litigation track, critics and members of Congress sued. They argued it was illegal for Mr. Nixon to order the firing of the special prosecutor. They won. A Federal District Court ruled, in Nader v. Bork, that Mr. Nixon “illegally discharged” the prosecutor because he “did not serve at the president’s pleasure.” Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

It shows how even if a president gets the Department of Justice to do his dirty work, judges have the final say. They can keep prosecutors on the job. (With different facts and law, the Nixon case does not predict how courts would rule today on any potential removal of Mr. Mueller. But courts do have the power to reverse an illegal firing.) The promise for Mr. Trump comes in how he is pressuring the Justice Department. He may be reshaping law-enforcement leadership, and the key people around the Russia probe, without actually crossing into the potentially illegal firing of a special counsel. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In other words, Mr. Trump may be slowly bending the system and personnel toward him, without explicitly ordering people to choose between their job and Mr. Mueller’s job. That can build internal resistance to whatever Mr. Mueller ultimately finds, stacking skeptics around him. Indeed, few legal experts say firing federal appointees is itself illegal. (In an obstruction case, prosecutors look at how firings form one element of a wider plot.) Has Mr. Trump decided to pursue his Russia agenda through this method, having learned the red line — trying to get Mr. Mueller fired, which his own White House counsel reportedly threatened to resign over — is not worth the personal risk? To observe that this tarrying plot may be lawful is not, of course, to endorse it. Finding technically legal ways to grind down, pressure and reshape law enforcement is an affront to our constitutional democracy. It weeds out the type of independent public servants who are supposed to be in these posts. It invites partisanship and abuse. It undermines public confidence in the one institution that we trust to patrol, prosecute and even kill our fellow citizens. Mr. Nixon was unusual. He was both a crook and an institutionalist. On the one hand, he ordered crimes and tried to break the Justice Department. On the other, he complied with key court orders in Watergate and resigned when Congress drew a line on impeachment. We don’t know whether Mr. Trump ordered any crimes. Mr. Mueller is investigating that. We do know Mr. Trump is not an institutionalist. That is ominous, because it raises a grave question about what he would do if confronted with an existential choice about his presidency. If there is a lesson for the public and Congress here, it is that as with so many other Trump activities, do not underestimate him. Mr. Nixon targeted the special prosecutor in such a rapid spectacle that it backfired. Mr. Trump can be a quick study, at least on matters involving his own self-interest. Through trial and error, he may have learned that blatantly removing Mr. Mueller is bad for him. He may have learned purges are best served slowly. He may have learned that under the law, some of the big calls at the end of the Russia probe, like whether to release public findings, are not up to Mr. Mueller. Those calls are up to the acting attorney general for the case, Rod Rosenstein. The Saturday Night Massacre backfired because everyone could see it was a massacre in real time. The public, Congress and the courts may be girding for another “massacre.” It is vital to identify it correctly, however, in order to know when to go to the mat. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The next massacre may not announce itself, it may appear legal at first, and it may not even directly target Mr. Mueller. But if it is designed to fundamentally obstruct his investigation, or force the acting attorney general to hide the results when they arrive, that could be a massacre in the making.

It was Trump’s comments on Iran, however, that captured the attention of Rouhani, who had told NBC News Tuesday that if the U.S. backed out of the nuclear deal “no one will trust America again\" and that his country could then resume work on expanding its nuclear capabilities.

{"global_context": "President Donald Trump on Monday defended his long-promised border wall a day after White House chief of staff John Kelly said the structure at the center of the government shutdown fight is not technically a wall. Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. By Dartunorro Clark President Donald Trump on Monday defended his long-promised border wall a day after outgoing White House chief of staff John Kelly said plans for a solid concrete structure were ditched early on in the administration. \"An all concrete Wall was NEVER ABANDONED, as has been reported by the media,\" Trump tweeted. \"Some areas will be all concrete but the experts at Border Patrol prefer a Wall that is see through (thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides). Makes sense to me!\" He later added, \"I campaigned on Border Security, which you cannot have without a strong and powerful Wall.\" Kelly, who will depart the administration on Wednesday, told The Los Angeles Times in an extensive interview published on Sunday that Trump's pledge to build a massive wall along the U.S.-Mexico is not referring to an actual wall. \"The president still says 'wall' — oftentimes frankly he’ll say 'barrier' or 'fencing,' now he’s tended toward steel slats,\" Kelly said. \"But we left a solid concrete wall early on in the administration when we asked people what they needed and where they needed it.\" Trump's Monday tweet comes amid a partial government shutdown that began Dec. 22 over his demand that Congress fund a $5 billion wall. He threatened to \"close\" the border if the money was not approved. Congressional Democrats, who take control of the House of Representatives after returning to Washington on Jan. 3, have shown little interest in funding what incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's deputy chief of staff called an \"immoral, ineffective and expensive wall — the wall that he specifically promised that Mexico would pay for.\" During his presidential campaign, Trump promised Mexico would foot the bill for his wall. He also insisted on precise terminology. \"It's not a fence,\" he said repeatedly before and after his election. But earlier this month, amid government spending disagreements, Trump attempted to rebrand the wall as \"artistically designed steel slats.\" \"The Democrats, are saying loud and clear that they do not want to build a Concrete Wall - but we are not building a Concrete Wall, we are building artistically designed steel slats, so that you can easily see through it,\" Trump tweeted on Dec. 18. Days later, he tweeted a picture of a steel slat design, calling it \"beautiful\" and \"totally effective.\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who met privately with the president on Sunday, said Trump was in a \"very good mood\" and is open-minded about a compromise if it “achieves his goals of securing our border.” Graham also reiterated Kelly's comment that the wall is not a concrete wall. \"The wall has become a metaphor for border security. And what we’re talking about is a physical barrier where it makes sense. In the past every Democrat has voted for these physical barriers,\" Graham said. Trump on Monday also defended his decision to withdraw American troops from Syria while declaring victory over ISIS, which prompted the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. He also blasted the \"failed generals\" who were \"unable to do the job before I arrived\" in an apparent jab to Mattis and other military leaders who have criticized his decision. \"If anybody but Donald Trump did what I did in Syria, which was an ISIS loaded mess when I became President, they would be a national hero,\" Trump said on Twitter. \"I campaigned on getting out of Syria and other places. Now when I start getting out the Fake News Media, or some failed Generals who were unable to do the job before I arrived, like to complain about me & my tactics, which are working. Just doing what I said I was going to do!\" he added. In an interview with ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday, Retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal called Trump dishonest and answered affirmatively when asked if the president is immoral. He also said he does not believe that ISIS is defeated. “I don’t believe ISIS is defeated. I think ISIS is as much an idea as it is a number of ISIS fighters,\" he said. McChrystal worked as commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan in the Obama administration but was forced to resign in 2010 after making critical comments about administration officials at the time in a magazine interview. Graham told reporters Sunday after his private lunch with Trump that plans to withdraw 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria are \"slowing down in a smart way.\".

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Brexit protesters chant 'Nazi and scum' at Conservative MP Anna Soubry More than 50 MPs have called on the head of Britain's largest police force to improve their response to abusive protesters outside Parliament. Writing to Met Police commissioner Cressida Dick, the MPs cited \"serious concerns\" about the \"deteriorating public order and security situation\". It comes after Conservative MP Anna Soubry was verbally abused on Monday. She was shouted at - including being called a liar and a Nazi - during live TV interviews on BBC News and Sky. The former minister was later shouted at, called \"scum\" and jostled as she tried to re-enter the Palace of Westminster. Ms Soubry later criticised police for not intervening and called for the protesters to be prosecuted under public order laws. The Met said it is investigating whether any crimes were committed, after having received a third-party report of a public order offence on College Green. College Green - the area opposite Parliament - is regularly used by media to interview politicians, as well as being a popular site for protesters to gather. 'Far right and extreme right' Labour MP Stephen Doughty coordinated the letter to Met Police chief Ms Dick, which has been signed by at least 55 MPs. The cross-party group of MPs - which includes those both for and against Brexit - said many of the concerns had been \"repeatedly raised\" with officers and senior policing staff. \"We write to express our serious concerns about the deteriorating public order and security situation in and around the exterior of the Parliamentary estate including College Green,\" the letter read. Image copyright PA Met Police commissioner Cressida Dick took up the job in 2017 \"After months of peaceful and calm protests by groups representing a range of political views on Brexit, an ugly element of individuals with strong far right and extreme right connections - which your officers are well aware of - have increasingly engaged in intimidatory and potentially criminal acts targeting Members of Parliament, journalists, activists and members of the public. \"We understand there are ongoing investigations but there appears to be an ongoing lack of coordination in the response from the police and appropriate authorities including with Westminster borough policing - and despite clear assurances this would be dealt with following incidents before Christmas - there have been a number of further serious and well publicised incidents today.\" The letter adds that it is \"utterly unacceptable for Members of Parliament, journalists, activists and members of the public to be subject to abuse, intimidation and threatening behaviour and indeed potentially serious offences while they go about their work\".

This is what has happened to our country.\" Ms Soubry, pro-European MP for Broxtowe and who supports another Brexit referendum, said she objected to being called a Nazi. Labour's Mary Creagh said the \"really vile, misogynistic thuggery\" that had been seen was not an isolated incident. She pointed to the murder of MP Jo Cox, who was killed in her West Yorkshire constituency by right-wing extremist Thomas Mair in June 2016. And Commons Speaker John Bercow said he was \"concerned\" about a \"pattern of protest\" targeting female MPs and journalists. Criticism came from different parties and all sides of the Brexit debate - including from high-profile Brexit supporters such as Piers Morgan who called it \"disgusting\". Also on Monday, political commentator Owen Jones published a video to Twitter that he had recorded while being followed and shouted at by a group of protesters outside Parliament. 'Unacceptable' Ms Soubry has been in touch with the parliamentary authorities responsible for security. Mr Bercow said he was aware of protests in recent weeks around the Palace of Westminster \"involving aggressive and threatening behaviour towards members by assorted groups that have donned the yellow vests seen in France\" - a reference to last year's \"gilet jaune\" anti-government demonstrations. While the Met had responsibility for security outside the parliamentary estate, he said, he was keeping a \"close eye\" on the issue amid concerns that women, in particular, were being targeted. \"I share 100% the concerns expressed and it's necessary to state very publicly the difference between peaceful protest on one hand and the aggressive, intimidatory and threatening protest on the other.\" No 10 said the incident was \"unacceptable\" and MPs \"should be free to do their jobs without any form of intimidation\". A Downing Street spokesman said there were laws dealing with public order offences and cases of harassment and threatening behaviour. The BBC and other broadcasters have set up temporary studios on College Green ahead of the big Commons vote on Theresa May's Brexit deal on 15 January.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May will pledge on Thursday to eliminate avoidable plastic waste within 25 years, in an attempt to shift the focus away from her government’s divisions over Brexit to a more wide-ranging domestic agenda. After months of headlines dominated by Brexit, scandal and an ill-judged election, May will try to show that she has a grip on domestic issues to help counter the rising popularity of the opposition Labour Party. In a speech on the environment, May will announce plans to close the exemption that means retailers with fewer than 250 employees do not have to charge customers 5 pence for a single-use plastic bag. Avoidable plastic waste is a term used by industry to describe products including plastic bags, straws, coffee stirrers, soda and water bottles and most food packaging. May will also urge supermarkets to introduce plastic-free aisles where all the food is loose and announce a consultation on changes to the tax system to help reduce the use of other single-use plastic items. “This truly is one of the great environmental scourges of our time,” May will say, according to excerpts of a speech released by her office. “In years to come, I think people will be shocked at how today we allow so much plastic to be produced needlessly.” May will say over 1 million birds and over 100,000 other sea mammals and turtles die every year from eating and getting tangled in plastic waste, while one in three fish caught in the English Channel contains pieces of plastic. In 2015, Britain introduced a charge of 5 pence on all single-use plastic bags provided by large shops, which led to an 83 percent reduction in UK plastic bags used in the first year. Earlier this week, a ban on plastic microbeads used in cosmetics and personal care products came into force across Britain. Worries about overuse of 2.5 billion disposable coffee cups each year have also been raised by campaigners, and the environmental audit committee last week called for a 25 pence “latte levy” to be charged on top of the price of a hot drink.

President Trump (Photo: Drew Angerer) WASHINGTON – President Trump began his post-Christmas break Tuesday with Twitter blasts on two issues likely to dominate his second year in office: Health care and the investigation into Russia interference in his 2016 election. Trump predicted that Democrats and Republicans will come together to overhaul President Barack Obama's health care law in the coming year, after Congress passed a massive tax cut bill that included a provision affecting the 2010 law. \"Based on the fact that the very unfair and unpopular Individual Mandate has been terminated as part of our Tax Cut Bill, which essentially Repeals (over time) ObamaCare, the Democrats & Republicans will eventually come together and develop a great new HealthCare plan!\" Trump tweeted.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 26, 2017 While Trump claims the bill \"essentially\" repealed Obamacare, the law is barely touched under the bill. What was repealed — effective in 2019 — was the requirement that nearly everyone have insurance or pay a penalty at tax time. Eliminating the individual mandate will likely mean less people insured; and that is likely to raise costs for those who do have it. Still, Trump seems clear on his goal to forge a new health care plan next year. The Republican-run Congress has so far been unable to find a compromise that would repeal and replace the law. The policy-focused missive was quickly followed by a loud denunciation of a report linking Russian election hacking to the his campaign. The dossier, put together by a political research firm and a British ex-intelligence official, claimed that Trump associates worked with the Russians to influence the election by hacking Democratic officials and pushing fake news. Citing the morning television program Fox & Friends, Trump again blamed the Democrats and presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for the dossier that surfaced just before his inauguration on Jan. 20. Tweeted the president: \"WOW, @foxandfrlends 'Dossier is bogus. Clinton Campaign, DNC funded Dossier. FBI CANNOT (after all of this time) VERIFY CLAIMS IN DOSSIER OF RUSSIA/TRUMP COLLUSION.

Bannon left Breitbart in August 2016 to join Trump's presidential campaign and later served as chief strategist in the White House. He was fired by Trump almost exactly a year after formally signing up with him. Bannon maintained his visibility by rejoining Breitbart in August and directing it to serve his political ends as the insurgent voice of the \"anti-establishment\" wing of the Republican Party, a faction that many critics saw as a socially intolerant and racist fringe of white nationalism. His departure from Breitbart followed what appears to have been a vote of no confidence from a key supporter and investor in the website, Rebekah Mercer, a wealthy political donor, said people at the company who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on Breitbart's behalf. Mercer and her father, hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer, own a minority share of Breitbart and are influential voices in its operation. Bannon provoked Rebekah Mercer's ire by making critical comments about Trump and his family to author Michael Wolff in a book, \"Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,\" published last week. Bannon is quoted as saying that Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, engaged in \"treasonous\" behavior by secretly meeting with Russian representatives during the campaign to get unflattering information about Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton. Trump replied to Bannon's comments with a statement savaging his former confidant. \"Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency. When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind,\" the president said. He later attacked Wolff and the book in a tweet in which he referred to Bannon as \"Sloppy Steve.\" Rebekah Mercer weighed in with a rare statement of her own Thursday that distanced her from Bannon. \"I support President Trump and the platform upon which he was elected,\" she wrote, adding that her family had \"not communicated with Steve Bannon in many months and have provided no financial support to his political agenda, nor do we support his recent actions and statements.\" Although Bannon continued to chair Breitbart's editorial meetings and host its satellite-radio program, Mercer's comments appeared to signal his end, people at the media company said. Breitbart's readers seemed to side with Trump in the spat. A person close to Bannon, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said \"there is no mass exodus\" at Breitbart and people were not entirely surprised by the news. \"It's not personality-driven anymore,\" the Bannon ally said of the website. \"We get to focus on the agenda. When it's about issues, Breitbart wins. We hopefully won't have the cult of personality tearing us down.\" Bannon has told associates he plans to focus on creating a political operation in 2018, the person said, and is banking that Trump eventually will need him again and that congressional Republican leaders will eventually desert the president. It is unclear if he can attract donors or operatives for his operation, though, and the person said that those around Bannon were frustrated by his moves in Alabama and his comments in Wolff's book. White House advisers said that Trump has shown no willingness to forgive him. As late as last weekend, Bannon continued to tell people that he planned to stay in charge at Breitbart and that he would keep his radio show. He argued that the show and the site were doing better than ever, even though associates have questioned whether that was true. In fact, the radio show would be another casualty of his split with Breitbart. Sirius XM said Tuesday that because its programming agreement was with Breitbart, Bannon would no longer serve as a host. Even on Tuesday morning, Bannon was preparing for the show, and he invited a friend, longtime political operative Patrick Caddell, to join him on a Wednesday broadcast to talk about immigration. But those plans ended after the announcement. Caddell, in a brief interview, said he was informed late in the day that Breitbart editor Raheem Kassam, not Bannon, would be hosting the Wednesday show. \"They said, it'll now be Raheem,\" he said. Bannon's ouster came on a day that underscored not only his fade from the power centers of the Republican Party but also his ideology's struggle to gain hold in Congress and at the White House. Trump, who nearly a year ago at his inauguration spoke of \"American carnage\" and struck nationalist tones, announced Tuesday that he would head to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland - a gathering Bannon detests - and signaled that he would be willing to work with Democrats on a deal to protect \"dreamers,\" the thousands of children of illegal immigrants, from deportation. As of Saturday, Bannon was still at Breitbart's Washington headquarters, a Capitol Hill townhouse known as the \"Breitbart Embassy.\" He lives upstairs, while the media operations are based downstairs. During his time in the White House, he told others that he was living in a high-rise building in Rosslyn, Virginia. It is unclear where he will live now. As his prospects seemed to cloud in recent days, Bannon grew darkly wistful, two people close to him, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said. They said he referred to Thomas Cromwell as a historical parallel of sorts to his own experience in private conversations. Cromwell served as the high-profile adviser to King Henry VIII of England in the 16th century but fell out of favor and was executed. Some conservatives who have worked closely with Bannon were harsh in response, all but writing his political obituary in the hours after the announcement. \"He's gone from the top of the mountain to the deepest valley, and it was all self-inflicted,\" said veteran GOP strategist Edward Rollins, who has worked with Bannon and is chairman of Great America, a pro-Trump group. \"Breitbart was his voice and it's been taken away from him, leaving him with nothing.\".

Photo: drazen gorgic/Reuters LAHORE, Pakistan—Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, convicted earlier this month of corruption, was arrested after he returned to Pakistan Friday, officials said, as his political party fights to retain power in the current election campaign. Mr. Sharif was arrested after landing at Lahore airport by officers from the National Accountability Bureau, the country’s anticorruption authority, said Shaukat Javed, the provincial interior minister. Mr. Javed said the former prime minister was put on a specially arranged flight to Islamabad. Mr. Sharif is expected to be held at Adiala jail, just outside the capital Islamabad, which has a high-security wing. The former prime minister was in London, visiting his sick wife, when a Pakistan court last week concluded a corruption case against him and ordered a 10-year sentence. His daughter and political heir, Maryam Nawaz Sharif, who returned with him Friday and was also arrested, was sentenced to seven years in the same case. Ahead of Mr. Sharif’s return, police swept through Lahore, arresting scores of Mr. Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League party workers to prevent them from greeting him at the airport. An injured Pakistani man is brought to a hospital in Quetta on Friday following a bomb blast at an election rally. Photo: banaras khan/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Barbed wire was strung across some roads leading to the Lahore airport on Friday and barricades were positioned at the roadside ready to close off main boulevards should crowds start to gather. Underscoring the security threat, more than 70 people, including a political candidate, were killed in a deadly attack on an election rally in southwestern Balochistan province on Friday. A suicide bomber blew himself up amid scores of supporters who had gathered at a rally in Mastung, a town in Balochistan. The candidate who died, Siraj Raisani, is the brother of the former Balochistan chief minister, Aslam Raisani. Caretaker Home Minister Agha Umar Bungalzai told the Associated Press that another 120 people were wounded in the bombing. An earlier bomb Friday killed four people in the northwest near the election rally of a senior politician from an Islamist party who is running for parliament from the northwestern town of Bannu. The explosion targeted candidate Akram Khan Durrani, who escaped unhurt, and wounded 20 people, said local police chief Rashid Khan. Supporters of the Pakistan Muslim League marched toward the airport to welcome home former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Photo: mohsin raza/Reuters Mr. Durrani is running in the July 25 vote against popular former lawmaker Imran Khan. He is a candidate of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, an election alliance of radical religious groups. The second explosion was the one that killed dozens and critically wounded the candidate Mr. Raisani. No one claimed responsibility for either bombing, but the attacks came days after a suicide bomber dispatched by the Pakistani Taliban killed secular politician Haroon Ahmed Bilour and 20 others at his rally in the northwestern city of Peshawar. Former lawmaker Imran Khan, who hopes to become the next prime minister, condemned Friday’s attack against his opponent. In a tweet, he said there seems to be a conspiracy to sabotage the July 25 vote.

{"global_context": "Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's years-old remarks questioning the landmark ruling that forced President Richard Nixon to turn over the Watergate tapes opened a new front in the battle over his confirmation, ensuring his views on executive power will square prominently in Senate hearings. Included in the thousands of pages turned over to the Senate Judiciary Committee this past weekend is a 1999 transcript of a panel discussion in which the future Supreme Court nominee opined whether the \"tensions of the time led to an erroneous decision\" in the case United States v. Nixon. Although Kavanaugh has defended the 1974 ruling in other remarks, Democrats have seized on his skepticism from nearly two decades ago to build a key argument against the nominee: That he won't be a sufficient check on the president who appointed him. \"If Kavanaugh would've let Nixon off the hook, what is he willing to do for President Trump?\" Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., asked Monday. Democrats have also focused on Kavanaugh's rulings in favor of broad presidential power and his criticism of the independent counsel law to suggest he would protect President Trump from special counsel Robert Mueller's probe. The judge has been outspoken in saying, for instance, that he would \"put the final nail in\" the now-defunct independent counsel law. But it is unclear whether Kavanaugh's dim view of the independent counsel law extends to separate special-counsel regulations governing Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Mueller's legal battle with Trump's lawyers over his request to interview the president could end up before the Supreme Court. On the Nixon decision, Kavanaugh's allies rallied to his defense. They contended he had praised the unanimous ruling in the case - which forced Nixon to turn over the Watergate tapes and ultimately led to his resignation - in other venues, such as a law review article in 1998 and a speech in 2016. But his comments suggesting Nixon was wrongly decided, which came during a roundtable discussion about government lawyers and attorney-client privilege, have drawn the most attention. Philip Lacovara, who had argued United States v. Nixon, said Nixon had taken the position that under the Constitution, no one in the executive or judicial branch could challenge his decision to prevent White House information from being released. \"This question is actually very interesting,\" Kavanaugh said, noting that Clinton White House lawyers involved in the 1998 roundtable discussion had not questioned whether the court's ruling was correct. \"But maybe Nixon was wrongly decided — heresy though it is to say so,\" Kavanaugh said, according to a transcript of the discussion published in the January-February 1999 issue of the Washington Lawyer. \"Nixon took away the power of the president to control information in the executive branch by holding that the courts had power and jurisdiction to order the president to disclose information in response to a subpoena sought by a subordinate executive branch official. That was a huge step with implications to this day that most people do not appreciate sufficiently.\" In an interview Monday, Lacovara said Kavanaugh was not being provocative or playing devil's advocate. \"The idea that Brett was expounding was this very philosophical approach\" regarding whether a president must disclose information because a government subordinate seeks it in a federal criminal investigation, Lacovara said. The White House did not respond to questions about the views Kavanaugh expressed in the discussion. His supporters and former clerks have noted he has called United States v. Nixon one of the three \"most significant cases in which the judiciary stood up to the president.\" Former independent counsel Kenneth Starr, for whom Kavanaugh worked during the 1990s probe into President Clinton, and two other deputy counsels issued a statement Monday stressing that they discussed the Nixon case multiple times during their investigation and that Kavanaugh \"viewed that decision as one of the most important decisions in Supreme Court history.\" \"We repeatedly relied on Nixon in opposing efforts by the Clinton Administration to shield important evidence from disclosure,\" said Starr and the deputies, Mark Tuohey and Bob Bittman. \"Our clear recollection of Brett's views on Nixon is that they are entirely consistent with those he expressed in articles published in 1998 (where he wrote that Nixon should be followed by the Supreme Court), in 2014 (where he identified Nixon as one of the 'most significant cases in which the Judiciary stood up to the President'), and in 2016 (where he called Nixon one of the 'greatest moments in American judicial history').\" Senate Republicans on Monday also dismissed Democrats' efforts to make Kavanaugh's views of the Nixon case an issue. \"It's clear that the #Resistance is attempting to distort, distract and deceive to smear a highly qualified nominee,\" Taylor Foy, a spokesman for Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said in an email to The Washington Post. \"A closer look at the public record shows a far different story than what the left is peddling.\" In a 1998 law review article, Kavanaugh said in a footnote that he assumed the courts would have the authority to weigh in on a special counsel's motion to enforce a subpoena because the Supreme Court had held so in Nixon \"and there is no reason to revisit that decision.\" Democratic senators said they would ask Kavanaugh to discuss the precedent in his confirmation hearing because he discussed it at the panel discussion. In addition to his comments on the Nixon ruling, Democrats also say Kavanaugh's past interviews, writings and judicial opinions reveal a philosophy greatly deferential to the chief executive — a view that Schumer has called \"almost monarchical.\".

But I think over time, they realized that my goal was just like the rest of them, which is how do you represent your country in a way that is strong and in a way that is helpful.” She admitted she faced a “massive learning curve” when she got to the UN. “It was a lot of reading,” she said. “It was a lot of deep dives.” One of her biggest goals when she arrived at the UN was to fight what she viewed as an anti-Israel bias. In December, the Security Council backed a controversial resolution condemning Israeli settlement activity. Under the direction of then-President Barack Obama, the US abstained from the vote, allowing it to pass. In March, at their annual conference, she told the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC “there is a new sheriff in town,” winning applause from the crowd. She was welcomed as a superstar during a trip to Israel, where she met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. She also toured the border with Lebanon, Syria and Gaza with top military commanders and visited the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial. Danny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the UN, credits Haley with “ushering in a new era of support for Israel at the UN” after she delivered a scathing speech at the UN Human Rights Council demanding a commission withdraw a report that described Israel as an “apartheid state.” The UN later rejected the report and the Secretary General asked the commission to remove it from the website. “The public support has made a huge difference for us,” Danon told me. “I think that member states and the UN agencies now understand they should recalculate their approach.” Critics argue that Haley is simply pandering to pro-Israel groups that are important to GOP politics. More than one State Department official has rolled their eyes over what they call Haley’s unabashed support for Israel. Even a senator who supports Haley said her work on the issue “is a bit much” for a UN ambassador. But Haley told me she sees an expansive role for herself. “It is what you want it to be,” she said of the ambassadorship. “I’ve found this is a place where you can move foreign policy.

President Donald Trump used the words of former President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for a border barrier and against illegal immigration to advocate Sunday for the same things. “We simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected, undocumented, unchecked, and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently, diligently, and lawfully to become immigrants in this country,” Barrack Obama said in 2005 while still a U.S. Senator from Illinois. “I voted numerous times when I was a senator to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in.

The barrier or the wall can be of steel instead of concrete if that works better,” he told reporters as he departed the White House. “This is a very important battle to win from the standpoint of safety, number one, defining our country and who we are. Also from the standpoint of dollars.

{"global_context": "Arizona's governor has named Rep. Martha McSally to replace U.S. Sen. Jon Kyl in the U.S. Senate seat that belonged to Sen. John McCain. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey announced Tuesday that McSally will take over after Kyl's resignation becomes effective Dec. 31. McSally last month lost a race for Arizona's other Senate seat to Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema. \"With her experience and long record of service, Martha is uniquely qualified to step up and fight for Arizona,\" Ducey said in a statement. \"I thank her for taking on this significant responsibility and look forward to working with her and Senator-Elect Sinema to get positive things done.\" McSally will serve until the 2020 election, when voters will elect someone to serve the final two years of McCain's term. Kyl was appointed after McCain's death from brain cancer in August. He previously served in the Senate for Arizona and had said he would only commit to serving until the end of 2018. The appointment puts Arizona back in the political spotlight just a month after Democrats won their first statewide race in a decade. Democrats hope that the state swings again in 2020 and are expected to target it both in the presidential race and the contest for McCain's seat. U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego, former astronaut and current gun control advocate Mark Kelly and former Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods, who left the GOP this year, have all considered running as Democrats for the post. The intense interest in the seat was a factor in Ducey's convoluted decisions. He initially appointed Kyl while the governor himself was campaigning for re-election. By picking Kyl, Ducey dodged tough political decisions that could have complicated his own re-election bid. McSally is a two-term congresswoman who was long considered for the Senate by the state's GOP establishment. The first female combat pilot, McSally once sued the U.S. military so she would not be required to wear a head covering while stationed in the Middle East. She rose to the rank of colonel in the Air Force before entering politics. She got a taste for it through working for Kyl's office as a national security aide. McSally represented a swing district in Tucson that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. She carved out a reputation as a moderate who could win tough elections. That went out the window during her Senate campaign this year. She had been critical of President Donald Trump in 2016 but praised him during the midterm election. Facing a primary challenge from her right, McSally embraced a tougher stance on immigration. But McSally was unable to defeat Sinema, despite playing up her military record against a Democrat who had once been an anti-war activist. McSally even contended that Sinema committed \"treason\" for saying she \"didn't care\" if an anti-war radio host fought for the Taliban during a 2003 interview. Sinema ran as a centrist, peeling away enough moderate Republicans from McSally to win by 2 percentage points. In a post-election memo, McSally strategists argued that she did well in a strong Democratic year and noted that the president never polled above 80 percent support among Arizona Republicans. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell lobbied for Ducey to select her. Still, many Arizona Republicans were disappointed by McSally's campaign and questioned whether she would be the strongest pick to fill McCain's seat, especially after she followed Trump's lead by failing to mention the dying senator's name during the signing of his last defense bill. That drew public reproaches from McCain's family. The most prominent Democrats cited as possible Senate challengers in 2020 are all men, which gave McSally an advantage. She is the only Arizona Republican female politician with Washington experience to have run statewide recently. ", "label": "neutral", "local_context": "Arizona's governor has named Rep.

{"global_context": "Once upon a time, the California Republican Party was a fearsome political instrument, forging the ground for two presidents. But today the California GOP is fighting rearguard actions to save its last remaining seats in once solidly Republican strongholds as Orange, San Diego and even in inland California, potentially costing them upward of seven House seats. The party is now so pathetic that a top party official crowed that GOP gubernatorial candidate John Cox might be “within 10 points” to the inevitable winner, Gavin Newsom. No doubt the architects of the earlier glory days like Stuart Spencer, Mike Deaver or Pete Hannaford would find this situation unbearable. What California needs is not a new Republican Party — at least at the state level — but what the late Kevin Starr called “the Party of California.” This party would target the growing independent constituency, now larger than Republicans, as well as Democrats who might be disaffected by their party’s relentless move to the left. Roots of a one-party state The roots of the Republican collapse lie largely in demographics: the steady loss of middle-class, middle-aged families, and the massive immigration of the 1980s and 1990s, which shifted he state’s ethnic profile. In 2012, the California electorate was barely half non-Latino white, but by 2030 it will drop closer to 40 percent. Some Republicans, including strong Asian-American candidates in Orange County, have made some breakthrough but overall this is ever more the party of aging white males. Economic changes have also played a role. California’s growth engine now rests almost entirely on tech oligarchs, large funders and, increasingly, media enforcers for the progressive agenda — at least as far as it does not threaten their vast wealth. The parts of the California economy that once backed the GOP, such as aerospace, oil and gas and suburban homebuilding, have fallen into a long-term secular decline. Much of the media, and virtually all progressive activists, will consider the collapse of the GOP as a positive development. Yet for Californians as a whole, one-party rule — as is usually the case — has engendered a growing disconnect between the political elites and the aspirations of electorate. Time for a Party of California If we had a functioning two-party system, California’s insane climate jihad — which has served to weaken most blue-collar sectors and boosted energy and home prices — would be reevaluated based on economic impacts as opposed to increasingly stepped up. Gov. Jerry Brown’s high-speech choo-choo would likely be abandoned or scaled back out of sheer embarrassment. But now California’s Democratic activists face few brakes on their power. They can, and often do, impose whatever controls on people’s lives and thoughts as possible, with little concern with push-back from the impacted masses. To stop this neo-Stalinist momentum, we need an opposition that does not carry the GOP’s toxic legacy on issues relating to gays, minorities and immigrants. Running a wealthy, carpetbagging, visionless non-entity like John Cox, who speaks mostly to the aging Reagan constituencies, seems a poor way to change perceptions. What would the Party of California stand for? This new party should not become some “third way” front for the super-rich and their technocratic approach to politics. It could even take some pages from Trump’s book of economic nationalism and populism, but throw away the arguably xenophobic excesses associated with the chief executive, a very unpopular figure in the state. Instead it would focus heavily on those parts of the state — pretty much everywhere outside Silicon Valley and fashionable coastal communities in Southern California — that have seen little high-wage job growth, and growing poverty under the current regime. What would a Party of California favor? It would stand for local control, which has support from about 70 percent of voters, according to a new USC Dornsife poll, and oppose the top-down policies favored by the state’s planning clerisy. The party might allow poorer areas, particularly in the interior, to increase their competitiveness by opting out of some of the fashionable progressive lunacy imposed by the Bay Area-dominated political class. This new party would embrace California’s obligations on the environment, but at a level congruent with policies adopted by most foreign competitors. It would seek ways to employ the very technologies developed here to make our suburbs and rural areas more sustainable. The current policy of “pack and stack,” favored by the planners, means simply higher prices and fewer residences that appeal to families.

These candidates, particularly should they win, could pave the way for others to consider running outside the two established parties. The GOP, hopelessly addicted to its declining base, cannot accomplish this, but an emergent Party of California might do the trick. Joel Kotkin is the R.C.

According to federal election data, Navarro received a total of $24,583.04 in “salary” and “monthly stipend,” financed by campaign contributions, during his unsuccessful bid to unseat Waters, D-Los Angeles. The payments were collected in approximately monthly installments of up to about $4,000 from April to October this year. A candidate paying himself a salary is “highly irregular,” said Kathay Feng, executive director of California Common Cause, who thinks the vast majority of candidates would refrain from doing it for fear it would look bad to voters and potential campaign donors. The practice is rare enough that, in interviews, several Southern California political professionals said they’d never seen it done before and exhibited confusion about whether it’s legal. It is legal under Federal Election Commission regulations governing campaigns for the U.S. Congress and president, although it’s prohibited by California Fair Political Practices Commission rules pertaining to campaigns for state offices. The FEC allows a candidate to receive a salary under certain conditions and specified limits. The rule change permitting a candidate to draw a salary was enacted in 2002 with the intent of making it easier for less-than-wealthy people to quit their jobs and seek public office. Navarro said that rationale applies to him. The 29-year-old Torrance resident said he had two jobs, working as an online marketeer and as an electronics salesman at a Target store. But he couldn’t work full-time after he got busy with his 2018 campaign, which marked his second losing run against Waters in California’s 43rd District. “You kind of shred through your savings,” Navarro said in a phone interview this week. “I started asking, ‘There must be a way to campaign and not go broke, you know?’ I asked my (campaign) treasurer, ‘Is there any way you (a candidate) can pay yourself a salary?’” The answer was yes. “I paid myself just enough. I didn’t pay myself an enormous amount,” said Navarro, who saw nothing wrong with it. Navarro said he was up-front with donors about drawing a salary, and said none objected. There’s no sign Navarro broke the FEC rules, which restrict when a candidate can draw a salary (starting no sooner than the deadline for filing to run) and how much he or she can receive (no more than he or she earned the previous year, and no higher than the salary for the office being sought). An FEC spokesman said a candidate can be ordered to submit tax records to establish previous pay levels, but that would happen only if the FEC turned up an irregularity or heard a complaint. That hasn’t happened in this case. But political observers said the fact Navarro, 29, drew a salary for running for Congress raised curiosity and perhaps ethical questions. “I’ve been doing this for 35 years and I can’t remember any candidate I worked for or against who took money and paid themselves a salary for working on the campaign,” said Fred Woocher, an L.A.-based election attorney for Democratic candidates According to 2018 election data supplied by the FEC, fewer than 30 candidates for the U.S. House and Senate nationwide — from among more than 2,500 seeking those offices — reported receiving a salary out of campaign funds. Only one California congressional candidate other than Navarro reported taking “salary” money: Andrew Janz, the Democrat who lost to Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Tulare, reported a one-time salary payment of $1,440.42 in October. Jaime Regalado, professor emeritus of political science at Cal State Los Angeles, said permitting candidates to receive salaries make sense because lack of personal wealth shouldn’t inhibit somebody from running. But he added a potential pitfall is “that people who don’t need the money would be paying themselves.” Feng, of California Common Cause, a good-government advocacy group, said most campaigns would not pay the candidate directly because they’d be afraid of “looking like they’re engaged in self-dealing.” “In this case, where a candidate has opted to pay himself a salary — and a fairly high salary — it would raise concerns from voters and donors about how well money is being spent. And whether, if elected, that person would be free from influence by donors,” Feng said. The concern is similar, Feng said, in cases where candidates’ relatives are paid for working on campaign or government staffs. Coincidentally, such concerns were raised about Waters when the congresswoman employed Mikael Moore — her grandson — as chief of staff in her Capitol Hill office. Moore’s job drew scrutiny because of his role in trying to secure federal bailout funds in 2008 for a bank in which Waters’ husband, Sidney Williams, held stock and served on the board. Waters was eventually cleared of ethics charges by the House Ethics Committee, but was named to the list of Most Corrupt Members of Congress published by the watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). Woocher said Navarro was making a “futile” run in the first place against Waters, a 14-term incumbent who represents the mostly Democratic district covering parts of L.A., Torrance, Hawthorne, Lawndale, Gardena, Inglewood and Lomita. Yet Navarro raised $988,984.34 in reported contributions between Jan. 1 and Oct. 17, all but $3,956 of that coming from individual donors rather than the Republican Party and political action committees. With endorsements from Michael Flynn, Joe Arpaio, Roger Stone and Alex Jones, Navarro apparently capitalized on antipathy toward Waters on the part of supporters of President Trump, who targeted Waters with insults after she said at an L.A. rally in June that people should “push back” if they see a Trump cabinet member in a public place, and “tell them they’re not welcome anymore, anywhere.” Waters, who reported $1,047,197.38 in contributions, won the Nov. 6 election with 77.7 percent of the votes to Navarro’s 22.3 percent. Waters’ 55.4 percentage point margin of victory was higher than the 52.2-point edge she enjoyed when Navarro challenged her for the first time in 2016. Navarro didn’t rule out trying again in 2020 but said he might run as a Democrat next time.

{"global_context": "Ukrainian authorities are failing to respond adequately to increasing cases of attacks and intimidation by radical groups, human rights groups said on Thursday. KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian authorities are failing to respond adequately to increasing cases of attacks and intimidation by radical groups, human rights groups said on Thursday. In an open letter to Interior Minister Arsen Avakov and General Prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko, the organizations rebuked the authorities for police inaction in response to violence against ethnic minorities, women’s rights activists and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. “It is no surprise that the number of violent attacks and threats by such groups is growing, as the inadequate response from the authorities sends a message that such acts are tolerated,” said representatives of Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Front Line Defenders and Freedom House. “We urge you to take effective action to prevent and stop acts that promote hatred and discrimination and hold those responsible to account.” A spokesman for the General Prosecutor declined comment while the Interior Ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The criticism is embarrassing for the Ukrainian authorities, who are keen to counter claims by the Kremlin and Russian media that far-right and extreme nationalist groups are prevalent in Ukraine. Since the Western-backed leadership came to power in 2014, Ukraine has received billions of dollars in financial aid, including from the European Union, partly in exchange for commitments to conform to international democratic and human rights standards. But the rights organizations said police have rarely launched investigations nor have perpetrators been prosecuted following at least two dozen violent attacks or threats by radical groups since the start of 2018. The letter highlights a number of incidents, including an attack on a Roma settlement in April, where masked men chased women and small children with rocks and pepper spray after burning down their tents. Elsewhere, around 50 members of radical groups disrupted a ‘Festival of Equality’ in the western city of Chernivtsi in May. “The police then led the event’s organizers and participants outside on the pretext that there was a bomb threat, where assailants attacked them by throwing heavy objects, including hammers, at them,” the letter said. “We have no information about whether an investigation into this incident has been launched.”.

{"global_context": "After weeks of uncertainty, Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar confirmed during a Saturday interview that he will campaign in favor of ending his country’s constitutional ban on abortion. But he appeared to short-circuit this process during a Saturday-morning appearance on BBC Radio’s Today program. Asked if he would favor a relaxation of the laws, Mr. Varadkar said: “I’ll be campaigning for them to be changed and to be liberalized, yes.” Mr. Varadkar’s announcement came one day after The Irish Times published an opinion poll that suggested a majority of Irish people, 56 percent, favor repealing the constitutional ban and permitting abortion for up to 12 weeks into a pregnancy, as recommended by a parliamentary committee. Only 29 percent were opposed to repealing the ban, a stark change from 1983 when nearly 67 percent of voters approved the introduction of the Eighth Amendment. Pro-repeal campaigners had contrasted Mr. Varadkar’s initial reticence with the stance of his chief rival, Micheal Martin, who heads the country’s main opposition party. On January 18, Mr. Martin announced that, despite having previously opposed repealing the ban, he now supported unrestricted access to the procedure in Ireland up to the end of the first trimester of pregnancy. Photo Mr. Martin’s decision, which he said was based on the medical, legal and personal testimony given to last year’s parliamentary committee on abortion, put him at odds with factions of his own conservative Fianna Fail party, which at its most recent annual conference voted overwhelmingly against repealing the ban. Mr. Martin’s directness also put Mr. Varadkar — whose Fine Gael party, although economically conservative, has a large socially liberal wing — in an uncomfortable position with elements of his own base. Mr. Varadkar was the fresh face of leadership last year when, at 38, he became Ireland’s youngest prime minister. He is the first Irish prime minister to have a nonwhite parent, and he came out as gay in the run-up to the successful 2015 initiative to legalize same-sex marriage. Previously, while a junior member of Parliament, Mr. Varadkar had taken a number of socially conservative positions. In 2010, he spoke against legalizing abortion for victims of rape, saying it would lead to abortion on demand. In 2009, he opposed changing the law to allow gay couples to adopt children.

View all New York Times newsletters. But during his Saturday morning interview, Mr. Varadkar said that his beliefs had evolved since 2014, when he had described himself as “pro-life.” “I think sometimes that term ‘pro-life’ and ‘pro-choice’ can be misunderstood. You know, I think even people who are in favor of abortion in certain circumstances are pro-life,” he said. “I still believe in life, but I understand that there are circumstances in which pregnancies can’t continue.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story He added: “Every single person I know who says they are pro-choice believes in some sort of restriction. These terms pro-life and pro-choice don’t really comprehend the complexity of this issue, which is a very private and personal one and one I think contains a lot of gray areas.” If repealed, the constitutional ban would be replaced by legislation regulating abortion, most likely permitting it under at least some circumstances. Mr. Varadkar’s government says it will disclose its proposed legislation before voters act on the constitutional provision, but it has yet to formally agree on what the measures might be. An all-party parliamentary committee voted in December in favor of permitting unrestricted abortion up to the 12th week of pregnancy, and later in cases of rape, incest or fatal fetal abnormality. Mr. Varadkar has yet to say whether he will support the parliamentary committee’s proposal. The proposal, though more restrictive than abortion laws in many Western countries, was more liberal than had been anticipated. Several committee members who had previously described themselves as anti-abortion said they had changed their minds after listening to medical and legal evidence, and personal testimony from women. Mr. Varadkar’s cabinet on Monday will try to agree on the wording of the referendum. Several thousand Irish women travel abroad for abortions each year, the majority to Britain. Figures from the United Kingdom’s health care service for 2015 showed that at least 3,400 Irish women had gone to England and Wales for abortions that year.

{"global_context": "Republicans have increasingly claimed that the memo written by GOP staff members of the House Intelligence Committee, which was declassified by President Donald Trump on Friday, shows how the FBI conspired with Democrats to interfere in the election and even spy on the Trump campaign. \"#FISAMemo shows real collusion between Dem operatives & key officials at the FBI & DOJ to spy on the #Trump campaign & interfere in the 2016 election. The politicization of our intelligence & law enforcement agencies should concern every American,\" tweeted Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, on Friday. Other Republicans have used the memo to suggest the probe by special counsel Robert Mueller began with tainted fruit, so it is no longer needed. \"Finally, there needs to be a discussion as to whether the Mueller investigation is truly needed, seeing that the main premise that launched the investigation turned out to not be credible and was both directed and funded by political opponents,\" Rep. Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., said on Twitter on Friday. A Duncan spokesman noted the tweet was more fully explained by a statement issued by the congressman: \"The entire basis of the investigation into possible collusion with the Trump campaign and the Russians, along with the corresponding media coverage, was based on false information spread by political and ideological allies to Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama.\" The president has even claimed vindication: \"This memo totally vindicates 'Trump' in probe. But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because, after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING, collusion is dead). This is an American disgrace!\" Trump tweeted Saturday. But the actual memo does not back up these claims - and in fact undermines them. The facts Much of the GOP memo is about the FBI obtaining a secret court order to monitor a former Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page. The memo alleges that the FBI did not fully disclose to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court that some of the information stemmed from intelligence reports provided by Christopher Steele, a former British spy under contract for a research firm working on behalf of Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee. The FBI, in a rare unsigned statement, said it has \"grave concerns\" about the accuracy of the memo. Here's the problem with the claim that the memo shows that FBI was spying on the campaign: Carter Page was no longer associated with the campaign when the court order was approved. Here's the timeline. March 16, 2016: In an interview with The Washington Post editorial board, Trump names Page as one of his foreign-policy advisers: \"Well, I hadn't thought of doing it, but if you want I can give you some of the names. . . Walid Phares, who you probably know, PhD, adviser to the House of Representatives caucus, and counterterrorism expert; Carter Page, PhD; George Papadopoulos, he's an energy and oil consultant, excellent guy; the Honorable Joe Schmitz, [former] inspector general at the Department of Defense; [retired] Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg; and I have quite a few more. But that's a group of some of the people that we are dealing with. We have many other people in different aspects of what we do, but that's a representative group.\" July 7-8: Page attracts attention by traveling to Moscow and delivering a speech harshly critical of U.S. policy toward Russia. He emails campaign officials about \"incredible insights\" from his trip. Aug. 5: The Trump campaign begins to back away from Page when The Washington Post reports on the unease in both parties caused by Page's remarks in Russia. Asked to comment on Page's public statements and campaign role, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Page was an \"informal foreign policy adviser\" who \"does not speak for Mr. Trump or the campaign.\" Sept. 23: The Trump campaign denies Page was ever part of the campaign. \"Mr. Page is not an adviser and has made no contribution to the campaign,\" campaign spokesperson Jason Miller said. \"He's never been part of our campaign. Period.\" The statement comes as Yahoo News reports that a U.S. intelligence probe was trying to determine if Page had \"opened up private communications with senior Russian officials - including talks about the possible lifting of economic sanctions if the Republican nominee becomes president.\" Sept. 26: Page himself announces he is taking \"a leave of absence\" from the campaign, saying the reporting on his remarks has created a \"distraction.\" Oct. 21: Nearly a month after the Trump campaign says Page was never part of the campaign, FBI seeks and receives a FISA court order to begin surveillance on Page. The order is renewed at least three more times over the next year, meaning that the FBI is able to convince the judges that surveillance continues to provide assistance to investigators. The Wall Street Journal reported that all of the judges who approved the orders were appointed by Republicans. Feb. 16, 2017: Trump denies he ever met Page. \"I don't think I've ever met him,\" he told reporters at a news conference. \"And he actually said he was a very low-level member of, I think, a committee for a short period of time. I don't think I ever met him. Now, it's possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don't think I ever met him. I didn't talk to him, ever.\".

The Senate Judiciary Committee endorsed Judge Brett Kavanaugh in a party-line vote on Friday afternoon. That sent his Supreme Court nomination to the full Senate a day after an emotional hearing in which a California professor leveled sexual assault allegations - allegations that Kavanaugh emphatically denied. The committee voted 11-10 to recommend Kavanaugh, with previously undecided GOP Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona supporting him. However, that support came with a last-minute caveat that holds major implications for a final vote. After meeting with Democrats behind closed doors, Flake, who earlier in the day announced he would endorse the nominee, emerged to call for a delay in a full floor vote to allow for an FBI investigation “limited in time and scope.” While backing Kavanaugh at the committee level, Flake said he'd only be \"comfortable\" moving ahead on the floor if the FBI investigates further. He said the pause should last for no more than one week. FBI officials told Fox News Friday afternoon that they had not been contacted by the White House to investigate Ford's allegations. The call throws into doubt whether Kavanaugh can win enough support. The FBI and Trump administration have balked at another investigation. But Republicans have a slim 51-49 majority and can afford few defections. The development caught the White House by surprise, just as the momentum started to shift in Kavanaugh's direction. “Somebody’s got to explain this to Trump,” Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, told reporters. “I guess that will be my job.” Minutes later, when asked by reporters whether he's willing to re-open a background investigation, President Trump said: \"I'm going to rely on all of the people, including [Sen. Chuck] Grassley, who is doing a very good job. That will be a decision that they are going to make and I suspect they will be making some decision soon.\" KAVANAUGH THREATENED ANEW WITH IMPEACHMENT AS SUPREME COURT VOTE NEARS The decision on timing for a vote will be up to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, though the administration has authority over any investigation. The Senate had been expected to launch into full debate over the weekend, with a final vote tentatively set for Tuesday. Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., later said that Republicans have \"reached an accord\" on how to proceed, but did not give any details. Flake earlier gave a major boost to Kavanaugh with a Friday-morning announcement that he would support him, saying, \"I left the hearing yesterday with as much doubt as certainty.\" But he immediately came under heavy pressure, with protesters accosting him and Democrats lobbying him on the sidelines to reconsider. If Flake remains a \"yes,\" there would be 48 pledged Republicans, with Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, the two remaining wild cards. Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., has not announced his stance, but is expected to support the nominee. Republicans need 51 votes to confirm. The vote Friday followed another heated committee meeting. Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, walked out of the meeting in protest. Klobuchar later returned. Once the speeches started, Democrats issued furious broadsides against Republicans, calling for them to delay the vote pending a full FBI investigation -- something Republicans have deemed unnecessary. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said that \"this is not a partisan moment, it is a moral moment in our nation.\" \"The pernicious patriarchy in this country must stop,\" he said before calling for a delay. When he finished his remarks, he snatched up his papers and rushed out of the meeting. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., said that the court was \"flying all the flags of a captured agency dancing to special interests' tune and ramming through precedent and principle to get there.\" \"This will be a disaster for the court, and I believe Kavanaugh will contribute to that disaster,\" he said. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., meanwhile, attacked Kavanaugh for his remarks at the committee hearing Thursday. In those remarks, the nominee blasted Democrats and those seeking \"revenge on behalf of the Clintons.\" Republicans did not back down on their rhetoric, with Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana decrying an \"intergalactic freakshow.\" \"Congress has hit rock bottom and started to dig,\" he said. Outside the committee room, Hirono told reporters that \"the American people need to stand up and see this railroad job for what it is.\" Before Flake's announcement, swing-vote Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana announced he would oppose Kavanaugh, citing in part the refusal to launch a new FBI probe into the allegations. \"I have deep reservations about Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination to this lifetime position and, as I stated, we have been unable to get all the information necessary regarding this nomination,\" he said in a statement. Another swing vote Democrat, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., later issued a statement backing Flake's calls for a short delay for an FBI probe. \"This has been a partisan and divisive process,\" he said in a statement. \"The American people have been pulled apart by this entire spectacle and we need to take time to address these claims independently, so that our country can have confidence in the outcome of this vote.\" The committee vote came a day after an angry and emotional hearing on allegations of sexual assault made against Kavanaugh. Both Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Kavanaugh of assaulting her at a high school party in the 1980s, testified before the committee on Thursday in an eight-hour session. Ford said she's \"100 percent\" sure Kavanaugh assaulted her. Kavanaugh emotionally denied Ford’s accusation, along with a number of others made against him in recent days. Kavanaugh trained his sights on committee Democrats. \"This confirmation process has become a national disgrace,\" Kavanaugh said. \"The Constitution gives the Senate an important role in the confirmation process. But you have replaced advise and consent with search and destroy.\" LINDSEY GRAHAM'S KAVANAUGH MOMENT EARNS CONSERVATIVE PRAISE Democrats pushed back, asking Kavanaugh why he would not himself urge an FBI investigation into the charges against him. Kavanaugh responded that he would assent to whatever the committee decided, but noted that an FBI probe wouldn’t draw conclusions, only gather information. Kavanaugh’s nomination is likely to see unanimous or near-unanimous opposition from Democrats, with only a few red-state Democrats even considering a vote for him. On Friday, Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., blasted Kavanaugh's testimony and said it showed him to be \"aggressive and belligerent\" and took issue with his attacks on Democrats. \"I have never seen anyone who wants to sit on the highest court in the land behave in that manner,\" she said. Republicans’ thin majority in the Senate at large gives the GOP very little room for defections. Sources told Fox News that former President George W. Bush has been making calls to Republican senators in an effort to help secure the confirmation. Fox News’ Chad Pergram, Jake Gibson, Peter Doocy and Shannon Bream contributed to this report.

Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. April 8, 2019, 11:21 PM GMT By Alex Seitz-Wald WASHINGTON — California Rep. Eric Swalwell will become the latest Democrat to enter the 2020 presidential race Monday evening in an appearance on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\" \"I see a country in quicksand, unable to solve problems and threats from abroad, unable to make life better for people here at home. Nothing gets done,\" Swalwell says in a clip released early by the show. \"I'm ready to solve these problems -- I'm running for president of the United States.\" \"It's official,\" he adds to cheers from the audience. \"Boy did it feel good to say that.\" \"The Late Show\" released the clip on Twitter a few hours before the show airs. Swalwell, a 38-year-old member of the House Intelligence Committee, is a prominent voice on questions of Russian interference in U.S. elections and other investigations into the Trump administration’s dealings with foreign powers. Swalwell has also made gun control a focus of his career and is due to hold a town hall Tuesday in Parkland, Florida, the site of the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Cameron Kasky, a survivor of the shooting who became active in the March For Our Lives movement for gun safety, was the congressman’s guest at President Donald Trump’s State of the Union Address and Swalwell wrote an op-ed last year saying he was inspired by the movement. Swalwell, who was the only congressman to endorse Martin O’Malley in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary, is the 15th major candidate to the enter the 2020 race and will have a steep hill to climb since he is largely unknown at the moment. The Californian was elected to the House in 2012 after defeating former Democratic Rep. Pete Stark, a 40-year-incumbent, in a bitter primary battle. Stark refused to debate his upstart challenger, leading Swalwell to hire an actor to impersonate him and speak only in actual Stark quotes while wearing fake bushy grey eyebrows. As Swalwell has already reminded first-in-the-nation caucus-goers, he was born in Sac City, Iowa, before his family settled in California. He attended the University of Maryland for both undergraduate and law school before working on Capitol Hill and then returning to California to become a prosecutor and hold other local offices. Swalwell has been a regular presence in Iowa and other early primary and caucus states and has been hiring staff to prepare for a potential presidential bid. \"The reason I would do it is because I have lived a life where I saw hard work paid off for my parents so that I could be the first in my family to go to college,” Swalwell said MSNBC last month. “Today, I have two kids under two. I'm paying off just under $100,000 of student loan debt. I know why people work hard, I know what they expect it to add up to. But when I look in different neighborhoods and different floors of different buildings I see that promise of America not reaching all Americans.” “I believe I'm a generational candidate who can bring inventiveness and optimism to a city, a place that's very pessimistic and I have experience,” Swalwell continued. “In the last seven years particularly the last few on Intelligence Committee our democracy has been on the ropes. I know who our threats are from the outside. I know who was attacking the rule of law on the inside and I'll stand firmly and defend it.”. ", "label": "neutral", "local_context": "Rep.

{"global_context": "Aurora teacher Maria Elena Jurado recently had a student crying on her shoulder. \"It is a feeling like no other,\" she said, recounting the situation to the Aurora City Council this week. \"They're scared. They don't know what's going to happen to them. This is the future, the students of this community, and they're looking for someone to speak up for them.\" Which is why Jurado and other members of an organization that calls itself the Freedom Coalition came to the council this week to speak in favor of what they call a Freedom Ordinance — in essence a welcoming city ordinance that the mayor's office currently is reviewing. Welcoming city ordinances are typically designed to alleviate fears of detainment and deportation for immigrants. \"People are usually scared to report crimes,\" said Juan Garcia, in support of the ordinance. \"If they get deported, what happens to their family?\" City of Aurora Aurora Deputy Mayor Chuck Nelson. Aurora Deputy Mayor Chuck Nelson. (City of Aurora) Aldermen were likely taken a bit by surprise at the people asking them to support the ordinance, because it has not made its way into the council's review pipeline. Deputy Mayor Chuck Nelson said the mayor's office talked to coalition members and it has a copy of a model ordinance, but it still is in the mayor's office. \"I hope it makes it to your desk,\" Garcia told aldermen. Aldermen are aware, however, that there is sympathy for such action in the community. Another organization in town, Indivisible Aurora, which also has a model ordinance, has talked with some aldermen about adopting such a provision. Nelson said the Freedom Coalition ordinance proposal appears to be based on a similar ordinance adopted by Oak Park. There are similar ordinances in Chicago, Evanston and Skokie. Such ordinances have been in the news since President Donald Trump issued executive order 13768, which calls for local jurisdictions to collect information on undocumented people in their communities and help federal officials enforce immigration law. The order threatens so-called \"Sanctuary Jurisdictions\" with a combination of the loss of federal grants, enforcement action and publication of crimes by \"aliens\" in their communities. The order seeks tighter adherence to Section 1373 of the United States Code which spells out communications between governmental agencies and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to help the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, or ICE, enforce immigration law. In response, many local jurisdictions across the country have adopted in some way regulations that are often known as sanctuary city or welcoming city ordinances. In essence, welcoming city regulations usually include: • A prohibition on local agencies or their agents requesting information or investigating the citizenship or immigration status of any person in the jurisdiction. The exceptions are if a court decision warrants it, or if that status somehow pertains to potential or actual legal actions of the public entity itself. • A prohibition on disclosing information about a local person's immigration status, unless federal law expressly requires it, or it is part of a court action. The ordinances usually include a caveat that recognizes that federal law does not allow such a prohibition. • A provision that says local government cannot threaten or coerce anyone, or threaten deportation, based on actual or perceived citizenship or immigration status. • Wording that says local governments cannot put conditions on local services to people based on citizenship or immigration status. • A provision that any questions about or reference to citizenship status is eliminated from any city applications and forms. • That local authorities cannot arrest or detain a person solely on citizenship status, or on administrative warrants from the FBI. They also often prohibit giving ICE agents access to a person being detained locally, and the use of local facilities for investigative purposes. Some also specifically say local jurisdictions cannot turn anyone over to ICE unless it has a valid criminal warrant. Some or all of these are present within welcoming city ordinances. There are also many other cities that have issued administrative directives to follow some or all of those guidelines, without a specific ordinance. Officials said that is what Aurora has done. \"Most of what they're asking for, we're already doing,\" Nelson said after this week's council meeting. \"Our message is that Aurora has always been a welcoming city.\" People at the council meeting this week noted that the state enacted some protection statewide with the Trust Act, which Gov. Bruce Rauner signed. \"That was fine, but it's not enough,\" said Erik Franzen, a bilingual teacher who has worked with immigration attorneys. \"We're asking that this city make the sacrifice to go further.\" slord@tribpub.com.

{"global_context": "The High Court rejected Marcus Ball's legal challenge over Boris Johnson's EU referendum claims. Image copyright PA Boris Johnson was a key figure in the 2016 Brexit referendum A man who took Boris Johnson to court over claims he lied during the 2016 EU referendum says he could continue with his private prosecution despite judges ruling it had no legal justification. Marcus Ball said he would \"keep going\" and appeal against the judgement if his lawyers advised him to do so. The High Court said it was not proved Mr Johnson had been acting in a public office when claiming the NHS could get £350m extra a week after Brexit. Mr Ball said this was \"concerning\". Speaking outside the High Court, he rejected claims that his actions were politically motivated, insisting it did not matter whether Mr Johnson became the next prime minister and there were wider issues involved. \"You cannot have an MP, a public office-holding MP, on TV speaking to millions of people lying about how the public purse is being used,\" he told the BBC. Mr Johnson's lawyers have always rejected claims he acted improperly or dishonestly in any way. Last month, the High Court threw out Mr Ball's attempt to prosecute the Tory MP and ex-Mayor of London on three counts of misconduct in public office. He had claimed Mr Johnson had brought his public office into disrepute by claiming repeatedly during the Brexit campaign that the UK gave the EU £350m a week and that this money could be recovered after the UK's departure and spent in full on the NHS. Flawed decision The £350m figure was used by the pro-Brexit Vote Leave group throughout the referendum. It also appeared on the side of the campaign bus, which urged the UK to \"fund our NHS instead\". The former foreign secretary, who is the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, was handed a summons to attend Westminster Magistrates' Court on 29 May. But Lady Justice Rafferty and Mr Justice Supperstone, sitting in the High Court, ruled that this decision had been flawed and overturned it. Marcus Ball said the case was not driven by politics Outlining their reasons on Wednesday, they said it was \"not sufficient\" to argue that Mr Johnson made \"contentious and widely challenged\" statements about Brexit and the NHS while he was an MP and London mayor and that this therefore represented a \"breach of duty\". They concluded it had not been demonstrated that Mr Johnson made the comments \"as he discharged the duties of the office\". They pointed out that Parliament had passed legislation to make it a criminal offence for anyone to make false statements about a candidate during a campaign for the purposes of stopping them being elected. But Parliament, they concluded, had \"deliberately excluded\" legislating to include false factual statements about statistics within the auspices of the criminal law. \"Parliament twice made a choice not to do precisely that which the interested party now seeks to achieve,\" they ruled. 'Abuse of trust' But Mr Ball said he still believed Mr Johnson's actions constituted \"an abuse of public trust\" and he was \"slightly concerned there has not been the level of engagement with our written submissions that I have would have preferred\". \"Our legal argument is that Mr Johnson was carrying out several duties of an MP,\" he added. Image copyright Getty Images \"Why do we elect MPs? One of the things they are responsible for is determining what happens to public money, where it goes, how it is spent, meaning they have authority and expert knowledge when it comes to the public purse.\" Mr Ball, who crowd-funded more than £300,000 to bring the case, said he would consult with his legal team before deciding whether it was appropriate to appeal against the ruling. He rejected claims the case was \"vexatious\", saying he could not have known Mr Johnson would be on the verge of Downing Street when he first considered legal action in February. \"I don't really care whether he becomes PM or not - that is separate to our work. \"If he does or does not become PM, that does not affect this case. We still keep going based on the legal advice we get.\" Mr Johnson's legal team argued that the offence of misconduct in public office should be about the secret abuse of power and there was nothing secret about the £350m claim, which they said had been challenged during the campaign.

{"global_context": "A question about last week’s election is impossible to answer, but it should spark discussions about voters in Chicago’s southwest neighborhoods and suburbs. The question is, how many of the 57,298 people who voted for Republican Arthur Jones in the 3rd District congressional race knew about his anti-Semitic and segregationist beliefs and voted for him anyway? Jones told me Tuesday he believes 100 percent of the people who voted for him knew about his views. Local and national media extensively covered his candidacy, he said. “They knew who I was,” he said. “It took some thinking on their part to vote for me.” Jones received 26 percent of the vote. Incumbent Democrat Dan Lipinski received 160,501 votes, according to unofficial results retrieved Tuesday from websites for the district’s four election authorities. On Nov. 20, county clerks will canvass results, which must be certified by Nov. 27. Surely, a number of people who voted for Jones knew that Republican Party leaders, anti-hate groups and others had denounced his candidacy because of his past affiliations with Nazi organizations, among other reasons. Others, no doubt, unwittingly cast their ballots merely because Jones was the Republican candidate. In an increasingly partisan climate, the “R” or “D” attached to a candidate’s name seems to matter more than an individual’s position on various issues. Now, a week after the midterm election, the Southland is faced with two disturbing possibilities. One is that tens of thousands of voters represent an electorate that is woefully uninformed. The other is that tens of thousands of people voted for a candidate who campaigned on extreme views. “I’m an honest man,” Jones said. “I spoke my mind on issues and voters appreciated my candor.” “The degree to which people are willing to express distasteful and previously taboo views is something we haven’t seen in a long time,” said Stephen Maynard Caliendo, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences and professor of political science at North Central College in Naperville. Reasons why people voted for Jones may be more nuanced than a simple binary choice, Caliendo said. Some may have voted for anyone but the Democrat. Others may have protested frustration over gerrymandering or other factors that stifle competition in a district that Lipinski was heavily favored to win. “It might be, ‘It’s a toss-away vote,’” Caliendo said. “It wasn’t a legitimate contest to begin with.” Protest voters had options other than voting for Jones. Three candidates registered as write-ins: Justin Hanson, Richard Mayers and Kenneth Yerkes. Jones received 34,670 votes in suburban Cook County, 11,576 votes in Will County, 10,876 votes in the city of Chicago and 176 votes in DuPage County. Jones won four precincts in the district: Precinct 5 in northeast Lockport Township and Precincts 1, 12 and 17 in Homer Township. The largest margin of those was in Homer 17, where Jones outpolled Lipinski 456-401. “Most of the people in Homer Glen are not racists or bigots,” said Steve Balich, a Republican Will County Board member who represents Homer Glen. “They may have voted for Jones because they didn’t know better.” Balich said he and other Republicans told people to not for Jones. Educated voters would know Lipinski is a social conservative who reflects the views of many Homer Township residents, he added. Others may be unfamiliar with the congressman who has represented the district since 2005. “Some people associate the Democratic Party with socialism — that’s the perception,” he said. “When the ballot says, ‘vote for one,’ you have a choice between a Nazi and a socialist.” There is evidence that some towns in the district have historically embraced policies that favor segregated housing. John Petruszak, executive director of Homewood-based South Suburban Housing Center, presented research at a White House conference on housing in 2012. “The 23 communities directly west of the south suburbs is an area of suburban Cook County generally known as the ‘southwest suburbs,’” Petruszak wrote in a research paper. “These communities have been traditionally perceived to be ‘closed’ by African-Americans, who comprised at the 2010 census only 6 percent (26,251) of the total 437,510 municipal inhabitants.” It can be painful and disturbing to think that tens of thousands of 3rd District residents voted for Jones because of his views about African-Americans, Jews and others. “It hurt me,” Elaine Savage, president of the nonpartisan League of Women Voters of the Palos Orland Area, said of the vote total for Jones. “It strikes the League of Women Voters very much because we’re out there trying to inform people.” It may be more comforting to believe voters just didn’t know any better than to consider the possibility that large numbers of neighbors would support views expressed by Jones. “I want to believe that people are uninformed,” she said. In Chicago, Jones pulled in nearly 25 percent of the 19th Ward vote that includes parts of Mount Greenwood and Beverly. The precinct with the highest vote percentage for Jones was the 21st, with 38 percent. Still, the 12,154 votes cast for Lipinski in the ward dwarfed the 3,908 votes cast for Jones. Researchers pointed out that Jones underperformed some of Lipinski’s other recent Republican opponents. Lipinski was unopposed in 2016. The 25 percent of the vote for Jones compares to Republican tallies of 35.4 percent in 2014 and 31.5 percent in 2012. “Looking back at the history of this district, I think people who knew about Jones stayed home,” said David Faris, assistant professor of political science at Roosevelt University in Chicago. “I think Jones lost about 10 percent of the Republican vote.” The problem, Faris and others said, is that the 3rd District and many others are viewed as noncompetitive because political parties too often build in unfair advantages during the redistricting process. “This would be much more disturbing if this was a competitive race,” Faris said. “It’s such a foregone conclusion” that a Democrat will win the district, he said. tslowik@tribpub.com Twitter @TedSlowik1.

{"global_context": "Sixteen states have filed a lawsuit in federal court in the Northern District of California against the president’s declaration of a national emergency, challenging this use of executive power as unconstitutional. Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. Feb. 19, 2019, 4:10 PM GMT / Updated Feb. 19, 2019, 4:48 PM GMT By Danny Cevallos Sixteen states have filed a lawsuit in federal court in the Northern District of California against the president's declaration of a national emergency, challenging his use of executive power as unconstitutional. The complaint seeks to bar the administration from invoking emergency powers to divert money from other federal programs to fund the border wall. Do states have standing to sue? The Constitution limits federal judicial power by permitting it only to consider \"Cases\" and \"Controversies.\" This fundamental requirement of \"standing\" is about whether plaintiffs—here, the states—have a sufficiently \"personal stake in the outcome\" of the litigation. To establish this threshold standing requirement, a plaintiff must demonstrate it has suffered a concrete injury, or that an injury is imminent. That injury must be traceable to the defendant. Finally, a plaintiff must demonstrate that if it wins in court, a court can redress that injury. States do not always have standing to sue the federal government. Historically, states did not have the duty or power to enforce their citizens' rights and relations with the federal government, at least according to a 1923 Supreme Court case. A state does have the right to assert interests in the physical and economic well-being of its populace. This concept of “parens patriae” alone, however, is not enough to give a state standing to sue the federal government on behalf of its citizens. However, modern courts, including the federal court where this lawsuit was filed, recognize that a state may have its own interests that are independent of the rights of its citizens, and that confer standing on the state to sue the federal government. California, for example, insists it has standing due to the loss of federal drug interdiction, counter-narcotic, and law enforcement funding caused by the Trump administration's diversion of funding. Colorado, by contrast, asserts that by virtue of being home to many military bases, such as the Air Force Academy, the use of funding for a southern border wall diverts funds for necessary maintenance and repairs to its military bases, and harms Colorado and its economy. When the Trump administration brings its motion to dismiss, the court must consider as a preliminary matter whether these injuries meet the constitutional requirement of standing. In a sense, every decision of every administration has at least an indirect effect on the states. That does not mean that every decision by the federal government is subject to challenge by the states. Years to declare an emergency? The states also allege that the president has long claimed a \"crisis\" at the border wall, but has not declared a national emergency until now. The plaintiffs have plenty of documentary evidence, including speeches and tweets by the president, to support their argument that the president does not honestly consider the border situation to warrant a declaration of a state of emergency. That might not affect the validity of the declaration itself. There are some legislative efforts to define a \"national emergency.\" For example, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) requires \"any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States.\" The National Emergencies Act, authorizes declarations of national emergencies under Acts of Congress authorizing \"any special or extraordinary power.\" Federal law contains no real guidance on whether the validity or definition of a national emergency turns on a president's honest belief that it exists. Nor do emergency declarations turn on how long the situation existed prior to the declaration. When the president declares a national emergency, and states that he \"didn't need to do this,\" it appears to undermine his declaration of an emergency. But a court might just consider these as off-the-cuff remarks that don't undermine the legal effect of the declaration of emergency.

{"global_context": "A guaranteed basic income can protect families from food insecurity and homelessness; for others, it can help them obtain education and job training. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, center. (Chris Helgren/Reuters) Christo Aivalis is a postdoctoral fellow in the history department at the University of Toronto. He is the author of “The Constant Liberal: Pierre Trudeau, Organized Labour, and the Canadian Social Democratic Left.” The new Progressive Conservative government of Ontario decided to break an election promise to allow a “basic income” (BI) pilot instituted by the previous Liberal administration to run to conclusion. This will leave thousands of Ontarians enrolled in the pilot without an income source they were promised for nearly two additional years. For some, the BI was protecting them and their families from food insecurity and homelessness; for others, it was enabling them to obtain the education and job training needed to improve their lives. Why, then, would the government break its promise and end the pilot? Social Services Minister Lisa MacLeod and other Conservatives argue that the very concept of a BI goes against their philosophy and that “the best social program is a job.” Giving poor people free money, they assert, will only perpetuate poverty and unemployment and waste taxpayer dollars (this despite the fact that nearly three quarters of BI pilot participants were already working). The government’s rationale is simply not in line with what history tells us about BI. In 1968, the Special Senate Committee on Poverty, chaired by Liberal Senator David Croll, was tasked with studying the nature of poverty in Canada. By 1971, the committee found that, as in the United States, many were still mired in severe intergenerational poverty. Croll’s main solution was to create a Guaranteed Annual Income. He argued that — despite the dogma that social assistance bred laziness and dependence — most people living in poverty either already worked, were involuntarily unemployed or were otherwise struggling through no fault of their own. Initially, the Pierre Trudeau Liberals rejected the idea on the grounds that a BI would endanger work ethic, while unions, anti-poverty activists and the democratic socialist New Democratic Party (NDP) supported Croll’s findings. By 1974, however, the Trudeau Liberals would team with the Manitoba NDP government to launch a BI scheme known as MINCOME, which would run until 1979. The data from the program went unstudied for years, but later scholars such as Wayne Simpson, Derek Hum and Evelyn Forget were able to show that the income had relatively “modest” effects on recipient employment, with the largest declines concentrated among male teenagers, who may have chosen to continue their education, and new mothers who may have been using MINCOME as a sort of maternity leave. In addition, Forget found that MINCOME could be linked to an 8.5 percent decline in hospitalization rates. The United States also conducted BI programs in urban and rural communities during the 1970s. Melissa Martin has compared MINCOME to American equivalents, finding that while decline in employment rates among recipients were higher in United States, they were smallest among breadwinners and were smaller than expected overall. One controversial side effect of a BI in the American context that wasn’t seen with MINCOME was an increase in divorce rates, but this has been disputed in the scholarship, and Martin notes that this may actually be a positive side effect when couples staying together only out of financial necessity no longer have to do so. All in all, there is ample data showing that while BI programs may have high initial costs, and do cause some declines in workforce participation, they don’t create a society of lazy moochers. Perhaps they should listen to other right-of-center intellectuals, such as Milton Friedman, who saw great social and economic value in a BI program. The former Conservative senator Hugh Segal, one of Canada’s high-profile champions of the BI, has critiqued his party’s cancellation of the pilot as a “horrific” act that not only harms vulnerable people trying to improve their lives but also turns its back on equality of opportunity, something all Conservatives supposedly hold dear. Many people have legitimate concerns about a BI program and its specific implementation, especially from the left, where some feel it would entrench existing patterns of inequality. But opposition in the form of hand-wringing about the “idle and shiftless poor” is ignorant at best, and disingenuous at worse.

Another $3.4 million in sexual harassment settlements was paid out by the University of California, or more precisely, by an insurance plan set up by the UC Board of Regents. For the three years ending last June 30, the newspaper found 92 sexual harassment settlements. There were 24 state agencies and 10 university campuses involved in the cases. The largest settlement was $10 million paid in 2016 by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to four young men who were allegedly coerced into sex acts by a male counselor at a state youth correctional facility. In another case, a woman collected a $1.7 million settlement from UC Berkeley after she was repeatedly harassed by her boss, the then-dean of the law school, and the university protected him, not her, after she reported it.

The state should be tracking and making public what it spends to defend or settle sexual harassment claims. Although individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty, a report on the number and cost of settlements could provide the only warning signal that a wider investigation is needed. It’s too easy for state agencies to take no action, secure in the knowledge that settlements will keep the facts hidden and the victims quiet. Sadly, the Legislature that should have been overseeing state agencies has instead been part of the problem.

New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker introduced legislation to end the federal prohibition of marijuana on Thursday, joined by a series of other announced and potential Democratic 2020 presidential hopefuls including Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Bernie Sanders, and Kamala Harris. Harris' support seemingly cemented her full-scale reversal on the issue. In 2010, Harris was among a handful of lawmakers — including then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger — to oppose Proposition 19, a measure to legalize recreational marijuana and allow it to be sold and taxed. Then San Francisco's district attorney, Harris called Proposition 19 a “flawed public policy.” The move comes as polling increasingly shows widespread national support for legalizing the drug. A Fox News poll last year showed that 59 percent of voters support legalizing marijuana -- up from 51 percent in 2015, and 46 percent in 2013. Only 26 percent favored making “smoking marijuana” legal in 2001. CALIFORNIA DOCTOR PRESCRIBES WEED COOKIES TO 4-YEAR-OLD FOR TEMPER TANTRUMS, LOSES LICENSES \"The War on Drugs has not been a war on drugs, it’s been a war on people, and disproportionately people of color and low-income individuals,” Booker said in a statement. “The Marijuana Justice Act seeks to reverse decades of this unfair, unjust, and failed policy by removing marijuana from the list of controlled substances and making it legal at the federal level.” Booker added: “But it’s not enough to simply decriminalize marijuana. We must also repair the damage caused by reinvesting in those communities that have been most harmed by the War on Drugs. And we must expunge the records of those who have served their time. The end we seek is not just legalization, it’s justice.” Booker's bill was co-sponsored not only by Harris, Sanders, Gillibrand, and Warren, but also by Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Or., Jeff Merkley, D-Or., and Michael Benne, D-Co. HOW KAMALA HARRIS' RECORD ON MARIJUANA HAS COMPLETELY CHANGED “Millions of Americans’ lives have been devastated because of our broken marijuana policies, especially in communities of color and low-income communities,” Gillibrand said. “I’m proud to work with Senator Booker on this legislation to help fix decades of injustice caused by our nation’s failed drug policies.” Added Sanders: “As I said during my 2016 campaign, hundreds of thousands of people are arrested for possession of marijuana every single year. Many of those people, disproportionately people of color, have seen their lives negatively impacted because they have criminal records as a result of marijuana use. That has got to change. We must end the absurd situation of marijuana being listed as a Schedule 1 drug alongside heroin. It is time to decriminalize marijuana, expunge past marijuana convictions and end the failed war on drugs.” For her part, Harris echoed Booker's sentiments and seemingly embraced her changed views on marijuana. Despite her past opposition to legalizing the drug, the former California attorney general recently boasted about smoking weed as a college student on the popular New York City-based radio program \"The Breakfast Club,\" telling hosts DJ Envy, Angela Yee and Charlamagne tha God that she's \"inhaled\" from a joint \"a long time ago.\" “I think it gives a lot of people joy. And we need more joy in the world,\" Harris added, claiming she used to listen to Snoop Dogg and Tupac Shakur — though they didn't release their albums during Harris' college years — while she reportedly got high. WHOOPS: HARRIS SAYS SHE GOT HIGH LISTENING TO SNOOP DOGG AND TUPAC ... BEFORE THEY MADE MUSIC In co-sponsoring Booker's bill on Thursday, Harris, like Booker, suggested that prohibitions on the drug disproportionately affect black men. “Marijuana laws in this country have not been applied equally, and as a result we have criminalized marijuana use in a way that has led to the disproportionate incarceration of young men of color. It’s time to change that,” Harris said. “Legalizing marijuana is the smart thing to do and the right thing to do in order to advance justice and equality for every American.” Warran, meanwhile, added: “Marijuana should be legalized, and we should wipe clean the records of those unjustly jailed for minor marijuana crimes. By outlawing marijuana, the federal government puts communities of color, small businesses, public health and safety at risk.\" Last year, California became the largest legal U.S. marijuana marketplace, Massachusetts opened the first recreational shops on the East Coast, Canada legalized it in most provinces, and Mexico's Supreme Court recognized the rights of individuals to use marijuana, moving the country closer to broad legalization. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP New Hampshire lawmakers on Wednesday gave preliminary approval to legalizing recreational marijuana, dismissing public safety and health concerns on a path to join scores of other states that have passed similar cannabis measures.

It would require any president to consult with the secretaries of state and homeland security before restricting entry to the country. And it would mandate that any such restrictions be based on “credible facts” laying out “specific acts” that could undermine national security, human rights, democracy or international stability. “Trump’s Muslim ban is unAmerican,” Chu tweeted. “[Coons] and I are introducing our No Ban Act today to not only repeal Trump’s hateful ban but also prevent any future president from issuing a ban based on religion or nationality.” Coons called the ban “a stain on America’s reputation” that is “hurting real people.” Multiple versions of the travel ban, which Trump first issued by executive order in January 2017, have been challenged in the courts. It was criticized as unconstitutional and discriminatory toward Muslims, since most of the countries in question were Muslim-majority. From the start, it was also met with public protests.

Candidates can, however, petition for a recount within five days after counties complete their vote computations. “I would rather be in Lamb’s shoes right now,” former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) said late Tuesday on CNN. About 11:30 p.m. Tuesday, Saccone came downstairs from the war room with his wife, Yong, his son, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren. “I just came down to let you know, we’re still fighting the fight,” he said. “It’s not over yet.” At one point a woman in the crowd yelled out, “There was some monkey business going on at the voting polls, Rick!” Saccone thanked his supporters and let them know they could go home, because his campaign would be working late into the night. Yet, win or lose, the result represents massive progress for the Democratic Party. It reflects the heightened enthusiasm of the party’s liberal base ahead of the 2018 congressional midterms, and it also signals dissatisfaction of many voters with President Donald Trump. The commander in chief carried the district by nearly 20 percentage points in the 2016 election. “The congressional map for potentially competitive races has just gotten a whole hell of a lot bigger,” said Mike Mikus, a western Pennsylvania-based Democratic consultant. “If I’m the Republicans, I’m terrified. If I’m the Democrats, I’m very energized looking toward November.” The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee claimed victory Tuesday night before a winner had been declared. Ben Ray Luján, the chair of the group, said the results should “terrify Republicans” who spent millions to defeat Lamb. “We have incredible candidates with deep records of service running deep into the map this year, and it’s clear that these Republican attacks are not going to stick,” he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Democratic-led U.S. House Judiciary Committee headed to court on Friday to seek access to grand jury evidence from the Mueller probe that lawmakers say they need to determine whether to begin impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) holds a news conference to discuss the Committee's oversight agenda following the Mueller Hearing in Washington, U.S. July 26, 2019. REUTERS/Erin Scott A second pending legal move by Democrats, a federal lawsuit to compel testimony from former White House Counsel Don McGahn about the Republican president’s efforts to impede the Mueller probe, is expected early next week. The grand jury evidence, which is protected from outside scrutiny by federal law, was compiled by former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s 22-month probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and Trump’s efforts to impede the investigation. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler told a news conference that since Justice Department policy prohibits the prosecution of a sitting president, the House of Representatives was the only institution of government capable of holding Trump accountable for actions outlined in the Mueller report. “The House must have access to all the relevant facts and consider whether to exercise its full ... powers, including a constitutional power of the utmost gravity: recommendation of articles of impeachment,” Nadler said, reading from the court petition. He also said Mueller’s grand jury information “is critically important for our ability to examine witnesses, including former White House counsel Don McGahn, and to investigate the president’s misconduct.” Committee Democrats, who flanked Nadler at the news conference, said the pending court petition was a new step toward impeachment and described their ongoing obstruction of justice probe against Trump as an “impeachment investigation,” though the panel has not officially launched an impeachment inquiry. But the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, Representative Doug Collins, criticized Nadler’s move. “Judiciary Democrats are suing for grand jury material to which they have no right,” Collins said in a statement. “Chairman Nadler’s legal action here is sure to fail, weakening Congress’s ability to conduct oversight now and into the future.” Nadler described the pending legal actions, including the McGahn lawsuit, as a potential watershed that could dismantle recent White House efforts to stonewall congressional investigators by directing current and former Trump aides to defy subpoenas and refrain from providing testimony. Mueller testified on Wednesday in back-to-back hearings that Democrats hoped would focus public attention on Trump’s alleged misconduct and boost support for an impeachment inquiry. But his halting and reticent performance changed few opinions, leaving House Democrats to accelerate a congressional probe that could take months to bear fruit. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who opposes impeachment for now as a politically risky move for Democrats, told reporters that she favored litigation to obtain “the best, strongest possible case” against Trump. But with the 2020 election campaign season fast approaching, she also made it clear that the impeachment issue would not be allowed to linger. “The decision will be made in a timely fashion. This isn’t endless,” said Pelosi, who denied suggestions that she was trying to “run out the clock” on impeachment. Mueller found insufficient evidence to allege that the Trump campaign conspired with Moscow in its effort to help Trump get elected in 2016, although campaign officials met with Russians. He also reached no conclusions on whether Trump tried to obstruct Mueller’s inquiry. Slideshow (4 Images) But Democrats say that testimony from McGahn could give them the evidence they need for an impeachment inquiry. A star witness in the 448-page Mueller report released in April, McGahn told investigators that Trump directed him to seek Mueller’s removal and then to deny that he had been instructed to do so. Democrats view the alleged episode as an act of obstruction of justice. McGahn declined to testify earlier this year after the White House directed him not to cooperate with the committee.

WASHINGTON ― A nasty primary runoff in Georgia this week helped explain why congressional Republicans are so afraid of taking on President Donald Trump. Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle had maintained a lead for the GOP nomination in the state’s gubernatorial race since May, when he fell short of getting the 50 percent of the vote needed to win the nomination outright. He was considered the front-runner in the race, the one who had the best chance of taking on rising progressive star Stacey Abrams in the fall. But it all fell apart when, in a surprise move, Trump endorsed Brian Kemp, Georgia’s secretary of state and Cagle’s GOP rival in the race. The announcement blindsided Cagle’s campaign and other GOP officials, including the leaders of the Republican Governors Association. A leaked internal tracking poll for Cagle’s campaign that was obtained by a reporter for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution showed how the lieutenant governor’s poll numbers nose-dived after Trump endorsed Kemp, who cruised to victory Tuesday. Greg Bluestein / Twitter The dramatic boost for Kemp is a testament to Trump’s enduring sway on the Republican electorate, despite growing criticism from GOP officials about his trade policies and his disastrous summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. “The president did not change the outcome, but it significantly impacted the margin, which means he had a very positive effect,” Sen. Jonny Isakson (R-Ga.) said Wednesday of Trump’s endorsement. Trump’s hold over the GOP voter base similarly explains the growing irrelevance of Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), one of the president’s loudest critics, who is retiring this year. A Democratic poll that was conducted in September of 2017, about a month before Flake announced his decision to retire, found the Arizona Republican with an abysmally low approval rating among GOP primary voters. While Flake has not let up in criticizing Trump’s words and actions, including what he called the president’s “Orwellian” attempts at bending truths he did not like into an alternative reality, he has so far refrained from taking substantive action to force him to change his behavior. As a conservative, Flake still supports many of Trump’s policies and nominees. In Kemp, meanwhile, Georgia has a Trump-picked gubernatorial nominee in the president’s image who touted his “big truck” during the campaign in case he needed “to round up criminal illegals and take them home myself.” Asked whether Republican lawmakers factored in Trump’s overwhelming popularity with GOP voters when considering whether to push back against the president’s policies, such as his planned federal assistance to the farm industry, a type of move they railed against for years, Isakson demurred.

{"global_context": "Negotiations in the U.S. House of Representatives on immigration legislation were on the verge of collapse on Tuesday as Republicans fought over how much protection to give undocumented \"Dreamer\" immigrants and as President Donald Trump ramped up his war against illegal and legal immigrants. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Negotiations in the U.S. House of Representatives on immigration legislation were on the verge of collapse on Tuesday as Republicans fought over how much protection to give undocumented “Dreamer” immigrants and as President Donald Trump ramped up his war against illegal and legal immigrants. FILE PHOTO: Protesters who call for an immigration bill addressing the so-called Dreamers, young adults who were brought to the United States as children, rally on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, U.S., December 20, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File Photo High-level talks were set for later on Tuesday involving House Republican leaders and warring centrist and conservative lawmakers in the party that controls both chambers of Congress. Some House Republican aides portrayed the closed-door session as crucial amid the deadlock. Failure to craft a compromise could result in renegade centrists forcing votes on the House floor on a bill that could pass with mostly Democratic support. Even if House Speaker Paul Ryan manages to write a compromise bill toughening U.S. border security and ending the threat of deportation for “Dreamers” - undocumented immigrants brought into the United States as children - his solution could be rebuffed by Democrats who are needed to enact any immigration bill. House aides familiar with this months-long effort to dislodge immigration legislation from a conservative blockade acknowledged that Democrats were not part of the consultations. Even some prominent Republicans viewed Ryan’s gambit skeptically. Republican Senator Jeff Flake, a central figure in efforts to protect Dreamer youths now that Trump wants to end the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that temporarily protects them from deportation, scoffed at the idea of the House moving ahead with a Republican-only bill. He added: “If it’s anything like what was part of the Goodlatte bill, that’s just not going to fly.” House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte has been pushing legislation to continue Dreamers’ temporary legal status, but without any prospect for U.S. citizenship. Embraced by the White House, the measure would reduce the amount of legal immigration and prevent U.S. citizens from sponsoring some relatives living abroad who want to relocate to the United States. A similar measure failed in the Senate last February. Meanwhile, on Monday U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions took actions that potentially could exclude foreigners seeking asylum from gang attacks, domestic abuse and other violence. On a related front, the Trump administration in recent months has ramped up a practice of separating immigrant children and parents who cross U.S. borders without visas and of holding them in detention centers. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the senior Senate Judiciary Committee Democrat, pledged to fight for legislation she introduced last week to end the practice. At a press conference on Tuesday, Feinstein acknowledged she neither had any Republican backers or a promise from Chairman Chuck Grassley to hold hearings on the measure. “Children are terrified, parents are heartbroken and families are being destroyed,” Feinstein said.

I have known Donna Brazile since the Al Gore Campaign in 2000. I am a veteran of Clinton Campaign’s since 1992 and I have worked on various Presidential and Congressional campaigns for the DNC and state Democratic Parties. I am a big fan of Donna Brazile, over the years I’ve come to appreciate and respect her work and support of grassroots organizing for the Democratic Party on all levels; national, state and local. And I understand her desire to tell her personal truth—no matter what anyone else has to say about it. Like her, I wrote a tell all book called “Race, Power & Politics—Memoirs of an ACORN Whistleblower” and faced similar blowback—from Progressives on the Left. However, I understand Democratic politics, and book publishing and promotions. A lot of people say they don't have a problem with her writing her book—but they have a problem with it being released right before the crucial off year elections in Virgina, New Jersey, Maine, etc. But here is the rub, Donna does not have any control over the release date—her publisher does. And the publisher wants to get the most publicity possible to recoup the large advance that they had to pay the author. Which, leads to point two. Donna does not control the publicity roll out for the book launch. The publicity department (for the publisher) does all of that. The publicist releases book excerpts and seeks book reviews, and schedules the author on talk shows and television shows. That's them—not her. The Donna Brazile controversy is about poor Media Literacy and Fake News. The cliff note version is that most Democrats are pissed at Donna over things she didn't have any control over. Yes… Donna wrote a tell all book--if you have a problem with that (I agree with you) but she still has to pay her bills. No... Donna did not release the book -- the publisher (Hachette Books) did. No... Donna did not distribute the book excerpts -- the publicity department did. No... Donna did not write the headline -- her publicist or Politico did. Additionally, most people are not very media literate; they don't know that while writers write the articles, it's the editors/publishers who write the headlines. So the entire political world went crazy when they read the provocative headline “Donna Brazile Says She Has “Proof” Clinton Rigged the Primary Against Sanders.” But the article was based on advance book excerpts from Hacks—Donna's new book. This whole thing went viral after Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren weighed in -- on television – after reading the Politico headline. Guess what? Donna didn't write the headline—and if you actually read the article / book excerpt; Donna only says that the DNC was so broke under Obama and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that the Hillary Clinton Campaign (HFA) had to bail it out. Which was true, however, HFA played hard ball with the finance agreement and took control of the DNC through their fundraising agreement. While, this does not sound very neighborly, it was perfectly legal—and any other candidate (i.e., Bernie Sanders) could have done the same thing. Fundraising is a necessary part of “Democratic Party Building” and the Clinton’s have been doing this for over forty years. Bill Clinton was always a Democratic Party Loyalist. He spent the majority of his career devoted to building the Democratic Party first in Arkansas then across America. When the Democratic Party was in the “Liberal” wilderness, Bill Clinton created/reinforced the Democratic Leadership Conference (DLC). The centrist leaning DLC ushered in an era of Democratic victories and success. Democrats became viable Presidential contenders again, and when Bill Clinton won the Oval Office in 1992—the Clinton Campaign folded its operations into the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and fought to build the Democratic Party (i.e., Democratic Majorities) across the country. Unfortunately, President Barack Obama did not expand upon the party building prowess that Bill Clinton displayed. In contrast, when Barack Obama won the White House in 2008, he did not fold Obama For America (OFA), his campaign into the DNC to build the Democratic Party. The DNC wanted the “secrets” to active the “Obama Coalition” of young people, minorities, women, LGBT, etc. They desperately wanted the Obama Coalition to be a durable Democratic Coalition that would guarantee electoral victory and success. Instead, he created a separate independent political organization called Organizing For America (OFA); and essentially left the Democratic Party to wither. During the last eight years Democrats lost: 68 House Seats 11 Senate Seats 12 Governorships 946 Legislative Seats Other candidates have used their failed presidential campaigns to create other organizations. For example, Jesse Jackson’s campaign became the Rainbow Push Coalition, Al Sharpton’s campaign became the National Action Network, even Pat Robertson’s campaign became the Christian Coalition. However, winning presidential campaigns typically fold into the National Party Committees (DNC and RNC) and become the defacto party building apparatus. Bill Clinton spent his formative years building the Democratic Party. Barack Obama spent his formative years immersed in a grassroots political organization (ACORN) that was aligned with—but independent of, the Democratic Party. The difference was striking. As a result, Donna Brazelle chaired a weakened and “broke” DNC that needed a financial infusion which HFA provided. Donna also complains that this agreement essentially made her a figurehead as Chairwoman, she could not spend money that she raised for grassroots organizing without permission from Brooklyn (i.e., HFA). And she, the DNC Chair, could not send yard signs to Louisiana — at all. Donna believes that exercising this type of control during the Primary, by one of the candidates, constituted a “cancer” on the party. This means that HFA had effective operational control over the DNC... before the General Election. But that does not mean, and Donna never said, that the Democratic Primary was rigged. So, that highly misleading headline went viral--but had nothing to do with what Donna actually wrote.

{"global_context": "Most of California's so-called sanctuary laws limiting cooperation with federal immigration authorities can continue to be enforced. A three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled unanimously Thursday that most of three California sanctuary laws limiting cooperation with federal immigration authorities can continue to be enforced, rejecting the bulk of a suit brought by the Trump administration. The judges declined to block the most contentious law, Senate Bill 54, which prohibits police and sheriff's officials from notifying immigration authorities when immigrant inmates are released from prison. In the opinion, Judge Milan D. Smith Jr. wrote: \"We have no doubt that makes the jobs of federal immigration authorities more difficult.\" However, he added that the law \"does not directly conflict with any obligations\" placed on state or local governments by federal law \"because federal law does not mandate any state action.\" The court also upheld a California law, Assembly Bill 450, mandating that employers alert employees of any upcoming federal immigration inspection share the inspection results with employees who may not be authorized to work in the U.S. Judge Smith, who was nominated to the federal bench by George W. Bush, ruled that the state law \"imposes no additional or contrary obligations that undermine or disrupt the activities of federal immigration authorities.\" The court did block part of Assembly Bill 103, which requires the state to review detention facilities where immigrants are held, ruling that a provision requiring the state to review circumstances surrounding the apprehension and transfer of detainees puts an impermissible burden on the federal government. \"Only those provisions that impose an additional economic burden exclusively on the federal government are invalid,\" wrote Judge Smith. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Justice Department sued California over its sanctuary laws in March 2018, with then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions saying that they hindered cooperation between federal and local law enforcement and prevents the government from enforcing federal immigration law. U.S. District Judge John Mendez previously threw out the federal government's challenge to Senate Bill 54, Assembly Bill 103 and part of Assembly Bill 450, but rejected a provision in the latter law that fines private employers who voluntarily allow immigration agents to visit workplaces. California officials have said the immigration laws promote trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who has repeatedly sued the Trump administration, mostly over immigration and environmental decisions, said the ruling shows that states' rights \"continue to thrive.\" \"We continue to prove in California that the rule of law not only stands for something but that people cannot act outside of it,\" Becerra said in a statement.

{"global_context": "Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed special counsel Robert Mueller, will leave the Justice Department after a tumultuous two years. CLOSE Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has submitted a letter of resignation to President Donald Trump. Time, Time WASHINGTON – Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, whose tumultuous tenure at the Justice Department was defined by his management of the sprawling investigation into Russian election interference, announced his departure Monday after two years in which he was often the target of President Donald Trump's scorn. Rosenstein, whose exit has been expected for months, submitted a resignation letter to the president in which he offered both gratitude to Trump and veiled references to the extraordinary challenges posed by the investigation that shadowed the first two years of Trump's administration. \"I am grateful to you for the opportunity to serve; for the courtesy and humor you often display in our personal conversations; and for the goals you set in your inaugural address: patriotism, unity, safety, education and prosperty,\" Rosenstein wrote Monday. His resignation is set to take effect May 11. Rosenstein's praise for the president comes less than two weeks after Russia special counsel Robert Mueller delivered a scathing account of Trump's conduct in which he repeatedly sought to limit or derail the investigation. While Mueller did not resolve whether Trump's actions were criminal, Rosenstein and Attorney General William Barr determined that there was insufficient evidence to charge the president with obstruction of justice. The investigation found that the Russian government launched a \"sweeping and systematic\" effort to intercede in the 2016 election and help Trump win the White House and that his campaign welcomed the assistance, but it did not find sufficient evidence to show that Trump or his aides conspired in the effort. The investigation – and its conclusions – have been a fraught and partisan issue since Trump's first days in office. \"We enforce the law without fear or favor because credible evidence is not partisan and truth is not determined by opinion polls,\" Rosenstein said in his letter. \"We ignore fleeting distractions and focus our attention on the things that matter, because a repoublic that endures is not governed by the news cycle.\" He also appeared to defend the inquiry that Trump has castigated as a \"coup,\" and for which Trump subjected him to public insults. \"Our nation is safer, our elections are more secure, and our citizens are better informed about covert foreign influence efforts,\" he wrote. Then he quoted Thomas Paine: \"Those who expect to reap the blessings of freedom must undergo the fatigues of supporting it.\" A career federal prosecutor, Rosenstein was thrust into an unusually public role for the agency's second-in-command almost immediately after taking office when then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself in the midst of the Russia inquiry. Sessions' disqualification ceded authority for the extraordinary investigation into whether the president's campaign conspired with the Kremlin to his 54-year-old deputy. Among his first actions as deputy attorney general, Rosenstein authored a memorandum that Trump used as the basis for firing then-FBI Director James Comey. Trump's abrupt action later became part of Mueller's examination of whether the president sought to obstruct the Russia probe. Comey's firing so shook public confidence in the Russia inquiry that just days later Rosenstein appointed Mueller, a former FBI director, to lead the investigation as a Justice Department special counsel. Throughout his tenure, Rosenstein often found himself in the middle of a politically-charged battle in which Trump and congressional allies cast the deputy attorney general as a ringleader in partisan \"witch-hunt\" while Democrats came to view the Republican as an unlikely guard against White House interference. Rosenstein noted in a New York speech April 25 that the Obama administration chose not to publicize the full story of Russian computer hackers and social-media trolls attempting to undermine the country. The FBI disclosed classified information about the inquiry to lawmakers, which was then leaked to reporters. The FBI director alleged that Trump pressured him to close the investigation, but the president denied the conversation occurred. \"So that happened,\" Rosenstein said. \"But the bottom line is, there was overwhelming evidence that Russian operatives hacked American computers and defrauded American citizens, and that is only the tip of the iceberg of a comprehensive Russian strategy to influence elections, promote social discord, and undermine America, just like they do in many other countries.\" Mueller's investigation concluded March 22 when Mueller submitted his confidential report to William Barr. The inquiry did not establish that Trump or his campaign had coordinated with Russian efforts to influence the election. Although the special counsel did not resolve the issue of whether Trump obstructed justice, Barr and Rosenstein concluded that the president's conduct was not criminal. Rosenstein rarely responded to the the president's criticisms even when their differences made him a likely target for dismissal. Indeed, Rosenstein had considered resigning from his post last year in the wake of a New York Times report indicating that the deputy attorney general suggested invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump. Rosenstein strongly denied the report, which indicated that he suggested recording Trump's conversations in hopes of triggering the president's removal from office. The incident prompted a hastily-called White House meeting where Rosenstein expected to be fired – only to return to the Justice Department later that day with his status unchanged. While at the White House, Rosenstein spoke by telephone with Trump who at the time was attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York. The two reached an apparent understanding that Trump later acknowledged. “My preference would be to keep him, and to let him finish up,” Trump said about Rosenstein, adding once again that the investigation “is a witch hunt.” While the deputy attorney general's relationship with Trump was often uncertain, Rosenstein was a steady defender of Mueller and repeatedly assured lawmakers that the special counsel was proceeding appropriately. After meeting with top members of the Senate Judiciary Committee in June 2018 – Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. – Rosenstein thanked them for their commitment \"to follow the facts wherever they lead without any improper outside interference.\" He said agents and prosecutors would base decisions on neutral standards and credible evidence, while completing the inquiry \"as promptly as is feasible.\" \"I'm very confident that when the history of this era is written, it will reflect that the department was operated with integrity,” Rosenstein told USA TODAY during a rare interview in March 2018. Trump nominated Jeffrey Rosen, the current deputy secretary at the Transportation Department, on March 26 to succeed Rosenstein. Career prosecutor Rosenstein had been a career attorney at the Justice Department before taking the No. 2 post. He graduated with highest honors from the University of Pennsylvania with a degree in economics and then earned a law degree from Harvard, where he was an editor of the law review. He clerked for D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Douglas Ginsburg. Rosenstein joined the department in 1990 through the attorney general’s honors program, and he prosecuted corruption case with the criminal division before taking a succession of roles in the department's headquarters. In the 1990s, he joined independent counsel Kenneth Starr’s investigation of President Bill Clinton. Rosenstein helped convict three onetime associates of the Clintons – Susan McDougal, James McDougal and former Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker – on fraud and conspiracy charges in May 1996. Former President George W. Bush appointed Rosenstein the U.S. attorney in Maryland in 2005 and former President Barack Obama kept in place to 2017. Trump made him deputy attorney general, setting Rosenstein up for his biggest clash yet. In his letter, Rosenstein said the Justice Department \"bears a special responsibility to avoid partisanship.\" \"Political considerations may influence policy choices, but neutral principles must drive decisions about individual cases,\" Rosenstein wrote, He quoted former attorneys general Robert Jackson, Edward Levi and John Ashcroft, all of whom have called for a Justice Department governed by impartiality and fairness. \"We enforce the law without fear or favor because credible evidence is not partisan, and truth is not determined by opinion polls,\" he wrote. \"We ignore fleeting distractions and focus our attention on the things that matter, because a republic that endures is not governed by the news cycle.\" Barr, who was attorney general under former President George H.W. Bush and returned to the post under the Trump administration, praised Rosenstein for his nearly 30 years with the Justice Department. “Over the course of his distinguished government career, he has navigated many challenging situations with strength, grace, and good humor. Rod has been an invaluable partner to me during my return to the Department, and I have relied heavily on his leadership and judgment over the past several months. I have appreciated the opportunity to work closely with him, and I wish him well in his future endeavors,\" Barr said in a statement. A presidential target Rosenstein's relationship with the president was fraught almost from the start. Thirteen days after Rosenstein was sworn in, Trump fired Comey, a decision that provoked a partisan uproar and that the White House initially said was based on a recommendation from the new deputy attorney general. (Trump later said it wasn't.) Comey's firing ultimately prompted Mueller's appointment. “I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt,” Trump tweeted in June 2017. I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 16, 2017 Trump, who ousted Sessions the day after the November 2018 midterm election, repeatedly criticized Sessions, Comey, Rosenstein and Mueller for their roles in the probe. In April 2018, Trump again called it a “Fake & Corrupt Russia Investigation, head up by the all Democrat loyalists, or people that worked for Obama. Mueller is most conflicted of all (except Rosenstein who signed FISA & Comey letter). No Collusion, so they go crazy!” Much of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the Fake & Corrupt Russia Investigation, headed up by the all Democrat loyalists, or people that worked for Obama. Mueller is most conflicted of all (except Rosenstein who signed FISA & Comey letter). No Collusion, so they go crazy! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 11, 2018 Lawmakers joined the fray. By February 2018, Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee released a report that documented that Rosenstein signed an application for a surveillance warrant targeting former Trump campaign aide Carter Page, as had Comey and two other deputy attorneys general. The criticism from House Republicans occasionally became heated. At a House Judiciary Committee hearing June 28, Republicans accused Rosenstein of hiding documents and argued that the 13-month investigation had already taken too long. \"We caught you hiding information!\" said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. Rosenstein wagged a finger at the congressman seated to his left, calling his remarks \"deeply wrong.\" \"It's not accurate, sir,\" Rosenstein said. \"I am not hiding anything from you.” Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., expressed his frustration with the Mueller investigation. \"Whatever you got, finish it the hell up!\" Gowdy implored, adding that the inquiry was \"tearing the country apart.\" \"I want him (Mueller) to finish the investigation as expeditiously as possible,\" Rosenstein responded. Rosenstein acknowledged in his April 25 speech that not everybody was happy with the investigation. But he said it helps to keep a sense of humor in Washington because politicians evaluate issues in terms of immediate impact and mercenary critics are paid to express passionate opinions. \"They make threats, spread fake stories, and even attack your relatives,\" Rosenstein said of professional provocateurs. \"My job is to enforce the law in a non-partisan way; that is the whole point of the oath of office.\" Read or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/29/deputy-attorney-general-rod-rosenstein-resigns-after-russia-probe-ends/1605373002/.

{"global_context": "WASHINGTON — Faced with biting public criticism from Republican Sen.-elect Mitt Romney, President Donald Trump pushed back Wednesday, reminding him that “I won big, and he didn’t.” Days away from joining the Senate’s Republican majority, Romney broadly criticized Trump’s policies and character in a newspaper column, arguing that the president “has not risen to the mantle of the office.” “With the nation so divided, resentful and angry, presidential leadership in qualities of character is indispensable,” the Utah Republican and 2012 presidential nominee wrote in a Washington Post op-ed posted online Tuesday night. “And it is in this province where the incumbent’s shortfall has been most glaring.” Trump fired back on Twitter, saying early Wednesday: “Here we go with Mitt Romney, but so fast! Question will be, is he a Flake? I hope not. Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other things where he can be helpful.” Trump’s warning shot referred to retiring Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who has been Trump’s most consistent critic among Senate Republicans. As he and other critics leave Congress, it is an open question who — if anyone — will take up the role of publicly criticizing a president who remains popular with Republican voters. Romney’s biting public assessment came as Trump and Senate Republicans faced a new governing dynamic. Republicans on Thursday will cede control of the House to Democrats, who were prepared to oppose Trump on a number of policies and promised a slew of investigations into his actions and those of his aides and campaign officials, particularly with regard to Russia’s election meddling. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, had criticized Trump before — notably, in a March 2016 speech he called Trump a “fraud” and opposed his bid for the GOP nomination — but later he made peace with the president-elect and even expressed interest in joining his administration. Romney’s rebuke of Trump drew a cutting reply from Brad Parscale, Trump’s campaign manager. In a tweet Tuesday night, Parscale said Romney “lacked the ability to save this nation” and contended that Trump “has saved it.” “Jealously is a drink best served warm and Romney just proved it,” Parscale wrote, adding he wished “everyone had the courage” Trump had. In the column, Romney offered approval of Trump’s corporate tax policies and efforts to cut regulations, appoint conservative judges and other “policies mainstream Republicans have promoted for years. But policies and appointments are only a part of a presidency.” “To a great degree, a presidency shapes the public character of the nation,” Romney said. He later added: “With the nation so divided, resentful and angry, presidential leadership in qualities of character is indispensable. And it is in this province where the incumbent’s shortfall has been most glaring.” While saying Trump’s early administration appointments had been encouraging, Romney added that, “on balance, his conduct over the past two years, particularly his actions this month, is evidence that the president has not risen to the mantle of the office.” In describing a “deep descent” by the Trump presidency in December, Romney cited the departures of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and White House chief of staff John Kelly and what he called the appointment of people of lesser experience, the abandonment of allies, and Trump’s “thoughtless claim that America has long been a ‘sucker’ in world affairs.” Looking ahead, Romney wrote that he would act as he would with any president from either party in the White House, supporting policies he believes are in the best interest of the country and his state and opposing those that are not. And he said he didn’t intend to comment on every tweet or fault. “But I will speak out against significant statements or actions that are divisive, racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions,” he said. Romney will be sworn in as a senator on Thursday.

And the Afghan Taliban isn’t on the State Department’s list of “Foreign Terrorist Organizations” (although, Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, its Pakistani counterpart, is) so it isn’t technically considered a terrorist organization. But after fighting it in Afghanistan in the “War on Terror” for almost 17 years, you’d be forgiven for mistaking it for one. So news of face-to-face peace talks between U.S. diplomats and the Afghan Taliban likely rubbed some people the wrong way. But talking with the Taliban is nothing new. The Obama administration started negotiations with the group in 2013. Those conversations led to the controversial Bowe Bergdahl trade. Now, as first reported by the Wall Street Journal, “The top U.S. envoy for South Asia met with Taliban officials [last] week to discuss ways to lay the groundwork for peace talks.” But these talks are also different in one important way. “Direct talks with the militants, without Afghan officials present, marks a major turnaround in Washington’s policy as it seeks to end America’s longest war,” the BBC reports. As the war in Afghanistan drags on, it brings us to our question of the week: Is it time to talk peace with the Taliban? Are we negotiating with terrorists? Does that even matter to you? Should the talks come with preconditions? Or should the United States be open to talking with the Taliban about peace at any time and any place? Should the United States insist that the Afghan government be involved? Or should U.S. diplomats concede to the Taliban’s demand for more direct talks between it and our government? The Taliban gave safe harbor to Osama bin Laden in the years leading up to the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks. Should we stay the course and see the Taliban destroyed?

After dealing with their own political infighting a few years ago, House Republicans are kicking up their feet and watching Democrats scrap it out for who will lead the party when it takes control of the lower chamber in January. A number of rank-and-file Democrats – tired of the entrenched leadership under Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. – are trying to make sure she doesn’t reclaim the role of House Speaker, despite her role in helping the party take back the House for the first time since 2010. This internal conflict may be dismaying for Democrats hoping for a unified party to fight the Trump administration, but it has the GOP jumping for joy. “For those asking, Moulton is NOT on our payroll,” National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) spokesman Matt Gorman tweeted last week, in reference to Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., one of the most vocal Pelosi critics. In the most open criticism of Pelosi, 16 Democrats put their signature on a letter earlier this week in which they vowed to oppose Pelosi in both the closed-door caucus vote and on the House floor. Despite the open hostility from some to Pelosi, it appears the California Democrat is slowly coalescing the party around here. Rep. Brian Higgins of western New York announced Wednesday he will now support Pelosi after earlier signing on to a letter opposing her bid. One day earlier, Marcia Fudge of Ohio announced she would back Pelosi after earlier flirting with the idea of running for the position herself. Pelosi still has a daunting challenge ahead to secure 218 votes, but she is growing closer to that threshold with an aggressive behind-the-scenes campaign focused on addressing some of her skeptics' top concerns. Pelosi seems certain to have enough support to become her party's nominee for speaker when House Democrats vote by secret ballot on Nov. 28. She will need only a majority of Democrats in that contest. But when the full House elects its new leaders Jan. 3, the speaker will need a majority 218 votes, assuming that no one votes \"present\" or misses the vote and Republicans oppose her en masse, as seems likely. While the large majority of Democrats support Pelosi, others are concerned that she is hurting Democratic prospects in key swing districts where she is unpopular with a broad swath of voters. The critics contend the 78-year-old Pelosi needs to step aside and make way for a new generation of leaders. Pelosi was the first woman to become speaker and served from 2007 to 2011.

{"global_context": "Most of 2014's C. American Children and Youths Still in Court Process. Federal agents have repatriated 90 percent of the Mexicans and 45 percent of the Central American adults who created the border crisis of 2014, but only a tiny share of the 2014 “Unaccompanied Alien Children,” according to September 2017 data reported by the Department of Homeland Security. Another one-third of the Central American UACs and one-fifth of the Central Americans adults were ordered home by judges, but had fled into hiding, says the report by the Department of Homeland Security. Overall, only about 2 percent of the 2014 Mexicans, 5 percent of the 2014 “Northern Triangle” Central Americans and 20 percent of the 2014 Central American UACs had been approved by judges to stay in the United States by last September, the report says. Those low approval numbers are far below the goals sought by progressives and many CEOs who are eager to welcome foreign migrants into the flooded blue-collar labor market. The DHS report is based on data collected in September 2017, so the repatriation numbers are likely to be significantly higher by September 2018. The clogged immigration courthouses ensured that judges were still working on legal claims filed by roughly 25 percent of the Central American migrants and 45 percent of Central American UACs, as of last September. Those courtroom delays were a big win for the Central American migrants, most of whom are working in blue-collar jobs, often to pay off smuggling debts to the cartels or to send money to their families at home. These 2014 migrants are the people who delivered President Barack Obama’s 2014 border crisis to the nation’s TV screens. That crisis wrecked Obama’s poll ratings and helped sink the 2014 “Gang of Eight” cheap-labor-and-amnesty bill. The crisis also allowed millions of Americans to shake off elite pressure and to start looking for a 2016 political candidate who was willing to solve the migration crisis. Since his resulting election in 2016, and amid bitter establishment opposition, President Donald Trump and his deputies have launched a series of reforms that are sending most recent migrants home and may greatly reduce new migration during 2019 and 2020. For example, many of the pending legal claims by the 2014 migrants will be rejected by judges in 2019 because of new rules and reforms established this Spring and Summer by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. He has hired more than 100 immigration-court judges, directed them to work faster, and ordered them to reject asylum claims that are based on fear of criminals’ violence or of domestic abuse. The DHS report included charts showing how many of the migrant groups had been sent home by last September. Ninety percent of Mexicans and 45 percent of Central American adults were home by last September. Roughly 65 percent of the Central American adults had been either deported or ordered deported by a judge. Few of the “Northern Triangle” Central American migrants aged younger than 18 — dubbed UACs — had been sent home, but roughly 30 percent had been either sent home or ordered home. Only 20 percent were given “relief,” or allowed to stay. Sessions has recently ended Obama’s practice of transporting smuggled UAC youths and children from the border to their illegal-immigrant parents via the shelters run by the Department of Health and Human Services. On Tuesday, Sept. 18, an official told Senators that enforcement officers had arrested 41 illegal migrants who tried to pick up their smuggled children from the HHS shelters. Few of the so-called “family unit” migrants were sent home, partly because Obama made it much easier for them to claim asylum from violent spouses or criminal gangs. Most of the “family units” are people from the Northern Triangle countries of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. However, half of the 2014 “family units” had been either ordered or sent home by last September, and less than 10 percent were allowed to stay. Many of the 2014 migrants remained in hiding, partly because the GOP-led Congress has not fully funded President Trump’s request for deportation funding, despite the growing number of court-ordered deportations. Overall, roughly 640,000 of the migrants who arrived in 2014, 2015 or 2016 remained in the United States, including 360,000 with pending court cases, while 936,000 migrants had been sent home. The reported repatriation rate for 2014, 2015 and 2016 migrants was far above the repatriation rate for migrants who arrived in the 12 months up to October 2017. Various legal loopholes and clogged courts ensured that only 1.4 percent of the 94,000 “family unit” migrants who arrived during 2017 were sent home by July 2018, according to agency data provided to Breitbart News. Only 252 migrants of the 94,285 migrants were quickly returned to their home country, and just 1,095 were formally “removed” after legal adjudication and deported home, by the end of June 2018. The data meant 92,938 of the 2017 family migrants — or 98.6 percent — were still in the United States as of June 30, 2018, up to 21 months after they arrived. Roughly 72,000 were still in legal proceedings, although only 4,279 were allowed to stay by June 2018. DHS also released basic information about the status of 31,754 UACs who arrived in 2017: In FY17, CBP apprehended 31,754 UACs from the Northern Triangle of Central America. Of those 31,753 illegal Central American alien minors, 98.2 percent remain in the country today (as of June 30, 2018). Many of the remaining 2014 and 2017 migrants will be sent home because Sessions’ reforms are already accelerating the repatriation of prior migrants. For example, Justice Department data shows that Sessions’ immigration-court judges are allowing far fewer migrants to stay in the United States than were allowed in 2015 and 2016 by Obama’s judges. The high acceptance rates in 2015 and 2016 were inflated because Obama’s judges “administratively closed” any migrants’ deportation cases. Many of those acceptance decisions will be reversed because Sessions has told judges they cannot “administratively close” case, and has told the agencies they should gradually put those case back into the immigration courts.

{"global_context": "The Senate is on track to pass a defense policy bill that pumps $700 billion into the Pentagon budget, expands U.S. missile defenses in response to North Korea's growing hostility and refuses to allow excess military bases to be closed. The legislation is expected to be approved on Monday by a wide margin in another burst of bipartisanship amid President Donald Trump's push for cooperation with congressional Democrats. The 1,215-page measure defies a number of White House objections, but Trump hasn't threatened to veto the measure. The bill helps him honor a pledge to boost military spending by tens of billions of dollars. Sen. John McCain, the Armed Services Committee chairman battling an aggressive type of brain cancer, has guided the bill toward passage over the last week as he railed against Washington gridlock and political gamesmanship. But McCain, R-Ariz., couldn't quell disputes among his colleagues over several contentious amendments that so far have been blocked from votes and failed to be added to the bill. Among them is a proposal by Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, that would have protected transgender service members from being kicked out of the armed forces. Gillibrand along with McCain seek to achieve the same goal through separate legislation they introduced late last week. The bill also is supported by Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Armed Services panel, and Collins. Another amendment, from Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, would have prevented the government from detaining indefinitely U.S. citizens apprehended on American soil who are suspected of supporting a terrorist group. Approved by the Armed Services Committee by a vote of 27-0 in late June, the Senate bill would provide $640 billion for core Pentagon operations, such as buying weapons and paying troops, and another $60 billion for wartime missions in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. Trump's budget request sought $603 billion for basic functions and $65 billion for overseas missions. With North Korea's nuclear program a clear threat to the U.S. and its allies, the bill would provide $8.5 billion to strengthen U.S. missile and defense systems. That's $630 million more than the Trump administration sought for those programs, according to a committee analysis. North Korea last week conducted its longest-ever test flight of a ballistic missile, firing an intermediate-range weapon over U.S. ally Japan into the northern Pacific Ocean. The launch signaled both defiance of its rivals and a significant technological advance. The legislation requires the Defense Department to deploy up to 14 additional ground-based interceptors at Fort Greely, Alaska, that will expand to 58 the number of interceptors designed to destroy incoming warheads. The department also is tasked with finding a storage site for as many as 14 spare interceptors, and senators envision an eventual arsenal of 100 with additional missile fields in the Midwest and on the East Coast. The White House, in a statement issued earlier this month, called the order for more interceptors \"premature\" given the Pentagon's ongoing review of missile defense programs. Although the bill calls for more military spending than at any point during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, major hurdles need to be cleared before all the extra money materializes. Congress would have to roll back a 2011 law that set strict limits on military spending. That's a tall order in the Senate, where support from Democrats will be necessary to get the 60 votes required to lift the so-called budget caps. As their House counterparts did, the Senate bill rejects Defense Secretary Jim Mattis' plan to launch a new round of base closings starting in 2021. He told lawmakers in June that closing excess installations would save $10 billion over a five-year period. Mattis said the savings could be used to acquire four nuclear submarines or dozens of jet fighters. But military installations are prized possessions in states and lawmakers refused to go along.

Glenn Simpson – the co-founder of the Fusion GPS research group that commissioned the unverified, Democrat-funded anti-Trump dossier – on Tuesday invoked his Fifth Amendment right not to testify during an appearance before the House Judiciary Committee. On Capitol Hill, Simpson declined to answer multiple shouted questions from Fox News about his refusal to testify as he arrived to the committee room. Late Monday, Simpson’s lawyer, Joshua Levy, took aim at Republican lawmakers for compelling him to appear. \"Compelling Glenn Simpson to appear for a confidential deposition after he has stated his intention to invoke his constitutional right not to testify reflects the worst practices of past congressional investigations and reinforces that this is a political exercise, not a serious inquiry,\" Levy said in a statement. The dossier, authored by former British spy Christopher Steele and commissioned by Fusion GPS, was paid for by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign through law firm Perkins Coie. It included salacious and unverified allegations about Trump's visit to Russia before he was president and has become a central focus as lawmakers investigate the origins of the Russia investigation. Simpson’s refusal to testify comes as other key figures connected to the dossier have been called to testify on Capitol Hill this week, as the House investigation into Justice Department actions during the 2016 campaign comes to a head. A deposition is also scheduled for Thursday with James A. Baker, the FBI’s former top lawyer. Baker, who had a close working relationship with former FBI Director James Comey, left the bureau earlier this year. Earlier this month, Baker testified about the genesis of the bureau’s Russia investigation, sources close to a congressional investigation told Fox News. He also testified that Perkins Coie lawyer Michael Sussmann gave him documents pertaining to the Russia probe, suggesting another connection between the early stages of the FBI’s Russia probe and those working with the DNC and the Clinton campaign, the sources said. House Republicans have also scheduled a deposition for Friday with Nellie Ohr, a Russia researcher for Simpson’s company. Ohr is married to Bruce Ohr, a Justice Department official who has also testified about his contact with Simpson during the campaign. “Is it really possible that Bruce Ohr, whose wife Nellie was paid by Simpson and GPS Fusion for work done on the Fake Dossier, and who was used as a Pawn in this whole SCAM (WITCH HUNT), is still working for the Department of Justice????? Can this really be so?????” President Trump tweeted Tuesday. Baker and Ohr are appearing for voluntary depositions, which take place as transcribed interviews under oath. The dossier, which has been at the center of an intense power struggle between congressional Republicans and the FBI, specifically cites the DOJ and FBI’s surveillance of Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, saying the dossier \"formed an essential part\" of the application to spy on him. Fox News learned Monday that Page has filed suit in Oklahoma against the DNC, as well as the law firm Perkins Coie, and its principals Marc Elias and Sussman over the dossier, and what Page claims were “slanderous” and “libelous” statements. \"It goes beyond any damages or any financial aspect,\" Page told Fox News' \"Hannity\" Monday night. \"There have been so many lies. You look at the damage it did to our democratic systems and our institutions of government back in 2016, and I'm just trying to get some justice in terms of getting some disclosure.\".

He grabbed a nearby book and placed it on the table. The title: “The End of North Korea.” “That,” he said, “is our policy.” His view has not changed. Last month, he pondered an American military strike against North Korea in a Wall Street Journal column titled “The Legal Case for Striking North Korea First.” Like Mr. Trump, he has been dismissive of the United Nations. In 1994, Mr. Bolton remarked about the United Nations’ headquarters: “The Secretariat building in New York has 38 stories. If it lost 10 stories, it wouldn’t make a bit of difference.” In that same speech, he said, “There’s no such thing as the United Nations.” At that time, Mr. Bolton had just left his position as an assistant secretary of state after Bill Clinton became president. His dismissive views of the United Nations, along with his hawkish ideology, led to a five-month showdown in 2005 between the Bush White House and Senate Democrats when President Bush nominated him as ambassador to the United Nations. The president ultimately bypassed the Senate and appointed Mr. Bolton as ambassador in August 2005 through a backdoor procedure known as a recess appointment. Asked by senators in 2005 about his harsh speech about the United Nations in 1994, Mr. Bolton shrugged off his criticism, saying that he was just trying to get the audience’s attention. “The comment about the 10 stories was a way of saying there’s not a bureaucracy in the world that can’t be made leaner and more efficient,” Mr. Bolton told senators. Mr. Bolton resigned as the United Nations ambassador in December 2006, around when his recess appointment was set to expire and as it was clear he would not win Senate confirmation. He believes the Iran nuclear deal is a ‘massive strategic blunder.’ The appointment of Mr. Bolton as national security adviser will place two of the most outspoken critics of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal around Mr. Trump. Both Mr. Bolton and Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director who was recently nominated as the next secretary of state, oppose the deal, which was made under President Barack Obama. Last October, Mr. Bolton wrote in The Hill that he believed senior advisers were giving “flawed advice” to Mr. Trump to preserve the deal. He warned, “Obama’s Iran nuclear deal is poised to become the Trump-Obama deal.”.

President Trump on Monday blasted Puerto Rico's Ricardo Rosselló as “a terrible governor” just hours after the leader of the U.S. territory announced he would not seek re-election amid corruption allegations that have led to widespread protests across the island. The governor, however, is refusing to resign. “The governor is not good,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “The U.S. gave Puerto Rico $92 billion and it’s in the hands of terrible and corrupt people…You have grossly incompetent leadership.” Rosselló, a Democrat, made the announcement that he would not run in a Facebook video on Sunday, but added that he was not giving in to demands of protesters to step down from his post. He also said that he agreed with the people's right to protest and was willing to confront the impeachment process, which already has begun in Puerto Rico's legislature. PUERTO RICO'S GOVERNOR GOES AWOL AS PROTESTORS GATHER OUTSIDE HIS RESIDENCE, US OFFICIALS CALL TO STEP DOWN The embattled governor said while he will not resign as the island's leader, he will step down as head of his pro-statehood party. Many Puerto Ricans have been calling for Rosselló’s resignation after leaked online chats showed him insulting women and political opponents as well as mocking victims of Hurricane Maria, one of the most devastating natural disasters to hit the island territory. Puerto Rico’s Center for Investigative Journalism earlier this month published nearly 900 pages of private messages between Rosselló and several other government officials. In one message Rosselló called one New York female politician of Puerto Rican descent a “w---e” and described another as a “daughter of a b---h.” One chat also made vulgar references to Latin pop star Ricky Martin’s homosexuality. His official residence has been under siege in the aftermath as hundreds of thousands of protesters gathered outside La Fortaleza, the governor’s official residence.

{"global_context": "Demographics isn't destiny in Texas. But 2018 could mark a turning point for Latino turnout. McALLEN, Texas ― Between Danny Diaz and the voters he wants to reach, there stands a fence. Usually, it’s a chain-linked fence, sometimes topped with barbed wire. There are picket fences, cinder-block fences and fences with metal railings capped with three-point tips. One of the grandest houses in the neighborhood where Diaz’s canvassers are knocking on doors has a fence with brick pilings and white stiles. It’s lined with statues of lions. And behind the fences, there’s usually at least one dog. “They make it hard to get to the door,” Diaz said. “You gotta look for that one person who knows everybody.” As a founder of Cambio Texas, a group dedicated to boosting the rock-bottom voter turnout rates of Hispanics in South Texas, it’s Diaz’s mission to get past the fences to the families inside. If your name is in his app, it’s because you’re registered to vote but haven’t been showing up. Cambio spends its time in working-class neighborhoods and in the unincorporated settlements along the border known as “colonias” in Hidalgo County, talking to people who almost never get contacted by political campaigns. Roque Planas/HuffPost Danny Diaz, in the foreground, leads a group of canvassers to knock on doors in a heavily Hispanic neighborhood of South McAllen, Texas, ahead of the 2018 midterm election. Beto O’Rourke, the hottest candidate that Democrats have put up for statewide office in Texas for the better part of two decades, needs exactly these voters to turn out if he is going to beat Ted Cruz and win a Senate seat. But with Election Day a few weeks away, the Beto campaign faces the same problem Democrats always face in this state and across much of the country: how to drive Latino voters, who skew Democratic when they vote, to the polls. Progressives hope that hostility to Trump will motivate Latinos to vote in greater numbers this year. But that hope should be tempered by the reality that activists like Diaz face: This is the work most likely to make a difference. It’s slow. It’s often unsuccessful. And in Texas, it’s only just beginning. Slow Work Cambio Texas is one of several groups trying to mobilize the Latino vote in Texas, and it’s far from the largest. But Diaz, the son of farmworkers and a longtime community activist in the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas, believes the group he co-founded in Hidalgo County has some of the key ingredients for success. Low Latino voter participation rates have become an existential threat to the Democratic Party in a majority-minority state whose demographics actually favor them. Republicans hold the governorship, majorities in both houses of the state legislature and haven’t lost a statewide election since 1994. No other state in the Deep South can boast such longstanding conservative control. In 2014, Democratic Party operatives built a multimillion-dollar effort led by organizing group Battleground Texas, rallying behind the candidacy of abortion-restriction filibusterer Wendy Davis. She lost her campaign for the governorship to Greg Abbott by more than 20 percentage points. President Donald Trump’s fulminations against Mexicans and vilification of the border on the 2016 campaign trail likewise spurred no surge of Hispanic voter mobilization in Texas. Having worked on the 2014 turnout campaign, Diaz is less inclined than most political observers to write it off as a flop. But he did see a problem — the efforts were led largely by out-of-staters unfamiliar with the region. At a barbeque he organized in a colonia to drum up support for Davis, he recalled a campaigner from the Northeast trying to convert residents to vegetarianism. Cambio’s volunteers, by contrast, are locals, most of whom speak Spanish and look like the people they’re talking to — an element that political science research generally views as key for success. Several of the canvassers can’t vote themselves, either because of their immigration status or because they’re still in high school. This midterm election cycle features no well-funded, Democratic-aligned campaign trumpeting its ambitions to turn Texas purple. But smaller groups like Cambio have formed to aid in the grunt work of registering and talking to more than 100,000 voters between them in an attempt to stoke enthusiasm. Cambio’s doorknockers are scoring enough victories to keep them motivated despite O’Rourke’s clear gap in the polls. When María Díaz — no relation to Danny — opened her door to a Cambio canvasser last week, she initially appeared skeptical as he launched into his spiel. Speaking in Spanish, José Coronado explained that O’Rourke wanted to raise teacher salaries. He wanted to make health care more affordable. He planned to hold a rally that afternoon at the McAllen Convention Center if she wanted to hear more. Diaz nodded politely, not visibly impressed. But she lit up when Coronado said O’Rourke wanted to save Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program that shields from deportation those unauthorized immigrants who arrived as children. Trump canceled the program, but federal judges in multiple lawsuits have temporarily blocked the decision. “I suffer for them, because I know people who have it,” Díaz said, announcing her intention to vote for O’Rourke based on that piece of information alone. “They’re so afraid.” Moments like these, however, are the exception. Over two hours of block-walking, few people opened their doors at all. Some of the houses were inaccessible due to the fences. One canvasser was chased away from a property by a pack of dogs. Why Latino Turnout Lags The people who do this work rattle off similar lists of reasons why Latino turnout in Texas remains so low. Texas Hispanics are disproportionately young and working class, two demographics less likely to vote, regardless of ethnicity. Since his days as a community organizer, the biggest challenge Diaz has faced is convincing people who work multiple jobs that it’s worth their time to attend a meeting or a rally. Party dynamics also play a role. The hard right’s vilification of immigrants and the border repels many Hispanics. But that doesn’t mean Latinos are flocking to the Democrats. Fewer than a third of 1,016 Texas Latinos identified as Democrats, according to a major report released by the Austin-based Latino civic engagement group Jolt. Most either called themselves independents or didn’t know which party to prefer. In the Democratic-dominated districts along the border, races are rarely competitive after the primaries, so the stakes are lower. Because conservatives have such strong control of Texas, money raised by the Democratic Party has a tendency to flow to more competitive races outside the state, which in turn undermines long-term turnout efforts. And most frustratingly for those trying to change the dynamic, political campaigns looking for cost-effective strategies generally prefer to curry favor with likely voters instead of signing up new potential voters. That’s why candidates and their political parties are also more likely to trumpet issues of concern to their base and likely voters, rather than the issues Latinos care most about. (At least among Texas Latinos, that issue is universal healthcare, according to the Jolt survey.) That negative feedback loop reinforces cynicism. What’s Different This Time Despite all that, activists like Diaz say they have reason to be optimistic. The grinding efforts of Cambio Texas have allowed them to reach some 13,000 voters in Hidalgo County over the last month. Several other grassroots organizations have also stepped into the fray. The national outfit Voto Latino registered some 52,000 voters this year, blowing past its figure for the 2016 presidential election by more than 30 percent. Private companies including Lyft are helping the group give those voters a free ride to the polls. Attorney Eric Cedillo, retired businessman Richard Marcus and former school administrator Rene Martinez founded a group to boost turnout among Latino millennials, whose volunteers registered around 7,000 people in the Dallas area since last year, mostly high school students. The Austin-based Latino civic engagement group Jolt, founded last year, has knocked on nearly 40,000 doors, also in Dallas, with the goal of speaking to each household at least four times before Election Day. Battleground Texas remains active, though it keeps a lower profile and its donations deflated this year to less than 15 percent of its 2014 haul of $8 million. Bloomberg Beto O'Rourke's campaign to unseat Republican Ted Cruz from the U.S. Senate has helped to upend some of the party dynamics that have historically diluted Latino voter turnout in Texas. It’s old-fashioned neighborhood canvassing — more than digital ads or resentment against Trump’s vitriolic rhetoric — that holds the most promise to boost Latino turnout, according to the Jolt report. That assertion is backed by Lisa Garcia Bedolla, a political scientist who’s studied the Latino voter mobilization campaigns of the 1990s, when the state flipped from red to blue. “We know if you meet people where they’re at and have conversations that are culturally competent, it works,” García Bedolla told HuffPost. “People keep saying that because Latinos feel threatened, they’ll get angry and vote. That’s not what happens. Some people do, if they have a history of political action or a counter-narrative… Other people will retreat to the things they can control and say, ‘That’s not for me.’” Democrats are putting up more competitive candidates, too. O’Rourke’s campaign has done a lot. In a cycle where the top of the Democratic ticket is weak — Lupe Valdez is trailing by a margin of around 20 points in her attempt to dethrone Gov. Greg Abbott — O’Rourke has made a statewide race competitive. And despite grumbling from candidates in competitive races elsewhere, the money he has raised is staying in Texas. Part of it has funded statewide block-walking events across the state. Transitory enthusiasm isn’t a substitute for longterm investment in turnout, Jolt Director Cristina Tzintzún said. But both O’Rourke’s efforts and the growth of community groups like hers and Cambio Texas appear to be pushing the state in a new direction. People keep saying that because Latinos feel threatened, they’ll get angry and vote. That’s not what happens. Some people do, if they have a history of political action or a counter-narrative… Other people will retreat to the things they can control and say, ‘That’s not for me.’ Political scientist Lisa García Bedolla “Beto is making as much headway as he is, not because of the infrastructure, but in spite of it,” Tzintzún said. “If you’re going to change Texas, any candidate needs grassroots groups registering Latino voters in off cycles. And the best groups to do that are community groups.” The success of these efforts won’t be clear until Nov. 6. For all the attention showered on O’Rourke by the national media, several major polls have him lagging Cruz in the upper single digits. Those are long odds. But most polls measure the preferences of likely voters, an inconsistently defined classification that ranges from people who say they’re likely to cast a ballot to people whom pollsters can confirm voted in recent elections. That makes this Texas election harder to predict. In recent years, Texas has averaged an annual increase of 100,000 new voters. But between the last presidential election and last week, when the Texas Secretary of State’s Office released its final tally, the number of new voters skyrocketed by nearly 700,000. Some of that growth benefits Cruz. Suburban counties, many of which lean Republican, saw some of the highest growth in registration rates. But the top four counties to gain voters — Harris, Bexar, Travis and Dallas — all went blue in 2016 and amassed more than a quarter-million extra voters between them. The border’s largest counties saw voter growth outpacing the state’s average as a whole. Registration in Hidalgo County, where Cambio Texas works, jumped by 7 percent. “The only hope O’Rourke has is that turnout is vastly different from what it normally is,” said Rice University political scientist Mark Jones. “But at the end of the day, all these new people that registered actually have to turn out.” As Cambio’s canvassers attempt to convince voters to do that, piercing the cynicism remains one of the most difficult obstacles. Diaz knocked on one door hoping to find a young man who had registered but hadn’t made it to the polls for the last election. His mother said he left for military duty and wouldn’t be back before Nov. 6. But she was registered, so Diaz turned his attention to her, probing in Spanglish for issues of potential interest. He found one when she told him she was uninsured. Had she heard of Beto O’Rourke? She had but wasn’t moved. She told HuffPost to make up a fake name if she was quoted for this article and refused to give her phone number to the canvassers, declining their offer to remind her to vote on Election Day. “They’re robbing us,” she said of politicians. “It gets me angry. I haven’t voted in years.” Diaz gave it one more try. “The border is being ignored,” Diaz said. “And traditionally it’s because only 20 percent of us vote. I know you’re frustrated, but please consider it.”.

{"global_context": "Kentucky’s Republican-majority House of Representatives took the extraordinary step Saturday of condemning the state’s Republican governor over remarks he made Friday amid teacher protests over his vetoes of a state budget plan that would have increased classroom spending. Kentucky’s Republican-majority House of Representatives took the extraordinary step Saturday of condemning the state’s Republican governor over remarks he made Friday amid teacher protests over his vetoes of a state budget plan that would have increased classroom spending. The rebuke came in the form of two resolutions – one filed by Democrats, the other by state Rep. John Carney, a Republican who claimed about 30 others in the GOP supported his resolution, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported. Thousands of teachers gathered at the state Capitol in Frankfort on Friday, trying to convince lawmakers to override the veto by Gov. Matt Bevin. More than 30 school districts across the state closed schools Friday so teachers could rally. Their effort succeeded, as lawmakers voted to override Bevin’s vetoes. But it was the school closures that prompted the remark from Bevin that outraged the teachers and drew the lawmakers' condemnation. “I guarantee you somewhere in Kentucky today a child was sexually assaulted that was left at home because there was nobody there to watch them,” the governor told reporters outside the Capitol. “I guarantee you somewhere today a child was physically harmed or ingested poison because they were home alone because a single parent didn’t have any money to take care of them. I’m offended by the idea that people so cavalierly and so flippantly disregarded what’s truly best for children.” As of Saturday, there was no comment about the rebuke from Bevin or from his office, the Herald-Leader reported. State Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester, told the Herald-Leader that Bevin should either clarify his statement or apologize. He added that it would be unfortunate if Bevin's remarks came to overshadow his accomplishments in office. “It hurts me to think that the things that have been done in this administration will be overshadowed by a statement that is not defensible,” Stivers told the newspaper. “If anyone asked me for my advice, I would say they should come out and make a statement, either clarifying it or being apologetic and getting the statement behind them. “It hurts me to think that the things that have been done in this administration will be overshadowed by a statement that is not defensible.” - Kentucky state Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester “But you are not known for your 99 successes,” Stivers continued. “You are known for the one blunder or failure, so I think he would be well served by saying or having a statement that he, in no way, was intending to harm or make inappropriate comment toward the people who were here (for the rallies.)” Bevin, 51, has been Kentucky's governor since 2015. Under his watch, Kentucky earlier this year became the first state to add a work requirement for qualifiying for Medicaid benefits. Bevin's remarks drew immediate backlash, Louisville’s Fox 41 reported. Republican state Sen. Max Wise of Campbellsville, the Senate Education Committee chairman, described Bevin’s comments as “disgusting.” \"The disgusting comments by Gov. Bevin insinuating that a peaceful protest by teachers would lead to sexual assault are reprehensible,\" Wise tweeted. \"I don't agree with these comments & I find them repulsive.\" Sen. Morgan McGarvey, D-Louisville, referred to the comments as “an outrageous and unsubstantiated slander of a group of people who dedicate their lives to teaching and caring for our kids.” Sen. Whitney Westerfield, R-Hopkinsville, said on Twitter Saturday that Bevin's comments had the effect of \"needlessly and unjustly demonizing\" teachers. House Speaker Pro Tem David Osborne said both parties felt a need to condemn Bevin’s remarks, the Louisville Courier-Journal reported. Stephanie Winkler, president of the Kentucky Education Association, said she was \"appalled\" by the remarks. \"There is no rational comment I could make to that,\" Winkler told the Courier-Journal. Meanwhile, the animosity between Bevin and the state’s teachers over school funding issues has prompted at least 40 current and former teachers to run for public office this year, most of them as Democrats. But Stivers predicted that Republicans would still retain control of state government after this year’s elections. The Associated Press contributed to this story.

Kennedy’s assassination and clashes between police and civilians. __ 10:45 p.m. Facing withering bipartisan criticism over his refusal to publicly acknowledge Russian election meddling during his meeting with President Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump says the two superpowers “must get along.” In a Monday tweet sent as he is flying back to the U.S. aboard Air Force One, Trump says, “As I said today and many times before, ‘I have GREAT confidence in MY intelligence people.’” He adds, “However, I also recognize that in order to build a brighter future, we cannot exclusively focus on the past — as the world’s two largest nuclear powers, we must get along!” Trump met with Putin for three hours Monday before participating in a joint press conference in which Trump did not contest the Russian leader’s election meddling denials. U.S. intelligence agencies have unanimously concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 campaign, most likely to help Trump’s campaign. __ 7:25 p.m. Russian President Vladimir Putin has rejected allegations that Moscow has collected compromising materials on U.S. President Donald Trump or his family. Asked during a joint news conference following their summit in Helsinki, the Russian leader dismissed the claims as “sheer nonsense.” Putin said that he hadn’t been aware of Trump’s visit to Moscow a few years before his 2016 election, which has been stained by accusations that Russians hacked and interfered in the campaign to support Trump. Putin, a former KGB agent, scoffed at the notion that the Russian security services try to gather incriminating materials on businessmen, saying: “Do you really believe that we try to shadow every businessman?” ___ 7:15 p.m. Russian President Vladimir Putin says he wanted Donald Trump to win the U.S. presidency, but strongly denied any Russian state meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. Putin argued that Trump’s calls for better ties during the presidential election campaign “naturally” made him a preferred candidate for many Russians. Asked if he personally favored Trump in the race, Putin responded: “Yes, I wanted him to win because he spoke of normalization of Russian-U.S. ties.” At the same time, Putin rejected the allegations of collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia as “complete nonsense.” The issue is a big concern for many U.S. voters. Putin spoke during a joint news conference with Trump in Helsinki. ___ 7:05 p.m. President Donald Trump says he sees no reason why Russia would interfere in the 2016 election. Trump resisted when asked Monday to condemn Russian meddling in the election. Instead, he complained about a Democratic National Committee computer server and emails belonging to Hillary Clinton, the Democrat he defeated to win the presidency. At a joint appearance in Finland with Vladimir Putin, Trump repeated the Russian leader’s denials about involvement in the election. Trump said of Putin: “He just said it’s not Russia. I will say this: I don’t see any reason why it would be.” Trump commented after holding hours of private talks with Putin. ___ 7 p.m. President Vladimir Putin says that Moscow and Washington could jointly conduct criminal investigations into Russian intelligence officials accused of hacking during the 2016 U.S. election campaign. Asked if Russia could extradite 12 Russian military intelligence officers indicted in the U.S. last week on charges of hacking into the Democratic election campaign, Putin challenged the U.S. to take advantage of a 1999 agreement envisaging mutual legal assistance. He said the agreement would allow U.S. officials to request that Russian authorities interrogate the 12 suspects, adding that U.S. officials could request to be present in such interrogations. Putin noted that Russia would expect the U.S. to return the favor and cooperate in the Russian probe against William Browder, a British investor charged of financial crimes in Russia. Browder was a driving force behind a U.S. law targeting Russian officials over human rights abuses. Putin spoke after a summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Helsinki on Monday. ___ 7 p.m. President Donald Trump says Russian President Vladimir Putin made an “incredible offer” to allow Russian and U.S. investigators to work together on allegations of Russian cyber attacks. Trump says Putin suggested the U.S. provide its intelligence to the Russian military so Russia can determine the truth of what happened. Trump says he has “great confidence” in his intelligence agencies who have concluded Russia interfered in the election. But Trump says Putin was “incredibly strong and powerful today” in his contention that Russia had nothing to do with election interference. The two presidents spoke during a joint news conference following talks in Helsinki. ___ 6:55 p.m. President Donald Trump says the Russia investigation has been a “disaster” for the United States and has kept America and Russia “separated.” Speaking during a joint news conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, he reiterates that there was “no collusion” between his campaign and the Russian government. Trump says he ran a “clean campaign” and he beat his Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton “easily.” The president says it’s a “shame” there is a cloud over his administration. He says he ran a “brilliant campaign and that’s why I’m president.” Putin is pushing back against claims that his government interfered in the U.S. election. He says there’s “no evidence when it comes to the actual facts.” Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

{"global_context": "The national party considered attorney Joe Cunningham one of its best bets for flipping a seat from red to blue. He delivered a late-night win. Joe Cunningham, a Democratic attorney in South Carolina, on Wednesday morning won the election to represent the state’s 1st District in the House of Representatives, taking the seat out of GOP hands for the first time since 1981 after a battle among conservatives for the Republican nomination. He defeated state lawmaker Katie Arrington, who’d bet that voters would reward her for her close association with President Donald Trump, in a race that became much tighter than expected in its final hours, appearing to swing to each of the candidates in turn, before ultimately being decided by a margin hovering at 1 percentage point. Arrington had seized the GOP endorsement from Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) in a May primary by highlighting his role as one of the few occasional Republicans in Washington to criticize the president. It was a striking blow for Sanford, a longtime Republican favorite who’d been prominent on the national stage as a governor whose second term ended in a dramatic extramarital affair, and as a congressman and vocal member of the fiscally conservative House Freedom Caucus. Arrington hewed close to Trump and presented herself as a straight-talker like him, often framing her race against Cunningham as part of a national fight to help the president. Her own race was, she said, a battle between good and evil. But despite the president’s popularity in the traditionally Republican state ― the latest poll found that his approval rating there exceeded the national average, though it’s still only 44 percent ― Arrington appeared to be in trouble in the run-up to Election Day. Last week, the House GOP’s campaign team sent her $87,000 to spend on television advertising despite earlier statements saying they did not believe she would need the help.

{"global_context": "It’s a new year — happy! happy! — and being even-numbered that means elections across the country. The political stakes, befitting the bigger-means-better Age of Trump, are considerably higher than usual. For the first time in years, control of the House is seriously in play and, with it, the prospects for the latter half of Trump’s presidential term, which could bolster his record for reelection in 2020 or prove a death march through a slough of subpoenas and congressional torment. Control of the Senate is a longer shot for Democrats, but also within the realm of possibility — especially after last month’s upset victory in Alabama. Not least, there will be 36 gubernatorial races in 2018. In many states the winner will oversee the once-a-decade redrawing of congressional boundaries, which will go a considerable way toward determining control of the House of Representatives, not just for one election cycle but well into the 2020s. Let’s start with the House. OK. There are 435 seats. Each will be on the ballot Nov. 6. To gain control, which they lost in 2010, Democrats need to win at least 24 seats held by Republicans. What’s the chance of that? Right now it looks pretty darned good. Midterm elections — so called because they fall at the midpoint of a president’s four-year term — tend to be a referendum on the incumbent, and that favors the opposition party because angry or unhappy voters are typically more inclined to turn out than contented voters. Hmm. Is that some kind of fake news? Actually, there’s plenty of history to support that assertion. Going back to 1862, the president's party has averaged a loss of 32 seats in midterm elections. In modern times, the president’s party has lost seats in 18 of the last 20 midterms, with an average loss of 33 seats. Elections aren’t based on history. What about the current environment? That’s also shaping up well for Democrats. Polls have found members of the party expressing far more interest in the midterm than Republicans, which is usually a sign of increased turnout. Also, on the so-called generic ballot question — which party would you rather see control Congress — Democrats are running significantly ahead of the GOP. That’s another positive sign for them. Finally, Democratic turnout in several special elections in 2017 ran considerably higher than expected — even in contests the party lost — which is another reason for Democratic optimism come November. So that’s it for Republican Speaker Paul D. Ryan? Not necessarily. There’s an old saying: (Fill in the blank) is a lifetime in politics. But we won’t trot out that tired cliche. Suffice to say it’s a long way to November. Anything to watch in the meantime? There’s a special election in late March to fill a vacant House seat in southwestern Pennsylvania. It’s strongly pro-Trump country — he carried the district by nearly 20 percentage points — but after the shocker in Alabama Democrats believe they may have a chance at another upset. If so, you’ll start hearing the W-word with increased frequency. “W” as in Wawa? No, that’s a chain of East Coast convenience stores. “W” as in wave. How about the Senate? There are 34 seats at stake in November, or just over a third of the 100-member body. Republicans will hold a 51-49 advantage once Democrat Doug Jones is sworn in as Alabama’s new senator. That means Democrats need a gain of just two seats to take control. So they have an even better shot at a Senate majority than winning control of the House? Actually, no. Huh? Of the 34 seats, Democrats will have to defend 26, compared with just eight for Republicans. And of those 26, 10 are in states that Trump carried in 2016. So to prevail, Democrats will have to hold onto every seat they have, plus two held by independents who vote with the party. Then they need to pick up at least two Republican-held seats. That’s a pretty tall order. Indeed. Their best shot appears to be in Arizona, where GOP Sen. Jeff Flake is stepping down, and Nevada, where Republican Dean Heller has the distinction of being the only Republican senator up for election in 2018 in a state won by Hillary Clinton. But in a wave year, other states could come into play. And those governor’s races? There will 36 gubernatorial elections across the country, in big states such as California, Texas, New York and Florida. Obviously, the winner will matter a lot to the folks living in those three dozen states. But the results will also have national import, owing to redistricting. Do tell. Every 10 years, after the latest census, the 435 House seats are reapportioned to reflect population changes across the country. In most states, it is then up to legislators to draw new congressional district lines, subject to gubernatorial veto. The way those lines are drawn can go a long way toward determining which party wins each seat. After the 2010 census, the Republicans used their upper hand in statehouses to diminish Democratic strength across the country, allowing the GOP to keep a firm grip on the House throughout the decade. In 2016, for instance, Republicans won 50.6% of the congressional vote nationwide but 55.4% of House seats, or 21 “extra” seats, according to an analysis by the Brookings Institution. When does the next census take place? In 2020. That’s a lifetime in politics! Please. CAPTION The House passes the Republican tax plan. The House passes the Republican tax plan.

{"global_context": "Counting is set to begin as a marathon - and bitterly fought - election draws to its conclusion. Image copyright Reuters Many see the election as a referendum on Mr Modi who won a landslide in 2014 Indians will finally find out on Thursday who won the general election after a long and bitter campaign. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stormed to power in 2014, campaigned hard to retain his commanding majority. He was up against the resurgent main opposition Congress party and powerful regional rivals across the country. Exit polls have predicted a win for Mr Modi, but analysts warn they have often been wrong in the past. The last of seven rounds of voting over six weeks ended on Sunday and the counting of the stored ballots begins at 08:00 local time (02.30GMT.) This election is seen as a referendum on Mr Modi, a polarising figure adored by many but also blamed for increasing divisions in India. A party or coalition needs at last 272 seats to secure a majority in the 543-member lower house of parliament, or Lok Sabha. In 2014, the BJP captured 282 seats - the biggest victory by any party in 30 years. The Congress, which won just 44, suffered its worst defeat. This year, there were 900 million voters eligible to take part, making it the largest election the world had ever seen.

The fate of more than 8,000 candidates and some 670 political parties hangs on the ballot. Results will be released in phases by the Election Commission - a picture of who is winning could emerge within hours, or it could take longer depending on how close the race is. Final results are not expected until late on Thursday local time, or early Friday. Extra checks matching printed ballots against electronic voting machine results could delay the process. India votes 2019 Who is likely to win? Mr Modi, with his tough image, remains the BJP's main vote-getter. The party and its allies could retain their majority, even if they lose some seats. Critics say promises of stellar economic growth and jobs have not been met, and India has become more polarised along religious lines under his leadership. His main rival is Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who is trying to win over an India weary of his family's dynastic grip on politics. The party's chances of winning a majority appear slim. It also failed to stitch up a pre-vote alliance in crucial states in the east and the south - a sign of its waning influence, analysts say. If neither of the two main parties can win an outright majority, powerful regional parties could play the role of kingmakers in a hung parliament. Image copyright Getty Images Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka must improve on a dismal Congress performance last time A string of exit polls all suggested this outcome was unlikely and predicted a BJP win, but the forecasts were rejected by the opposition. It's often said that whoever wins Uttar Pradesh, wins the Indian election. The huge northern state sends 80 MPs - more than any other - to parliament. In 2014 the BJP won 71 seats there. This time, a repeat performance seems far from certain. In a surprising move, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Samajwadi Party (SP) - bitter rivals - banded together to form a so-called \"grand alliance\" against Mr Modi. Together, they could chip away at the BJP's impressive 2014 seat tally. So the ruling party is hoping to make up for any losses with gains in states such as West Bengal, where it holds just two of the 42 parliamentary seats. Here, the BJP is up against Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee - a contest that produced some of the election's fiercest exchanges. Image copyright Getty Images West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has emerged as one of Mr Modi's fieriest opponents Four of India's five southern states - Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Kerala - have long eluded the BJP. Of the 91 seats in these states, the BJP holds just four. In this part of the country, the party contests few seats, relying instead on alliances with regional heavyweights. How do you count hundreds of millions of votes? Electronic voting machines or EVMs have been used in three Indian general elections before this one. They save money and time and results come within hours, rather than the nearly two full days it took when ballots were tallied manually. Each of India's 1.7m EVMs record up to 2,000 votes (the number of registered voters at any given polling booth does not exceed 1,500) and 64 candidates. After being unsealed they are individually inspected by counting staff and agents, overseen by a returning officer.

All the machines now have printers producing voter-verifiable paper audit trails to ensure transparency. Authorities will tally the paper trail slips - which are kept in separate sealed boxes - and compare them with the electronic result provided by the machine in at least 5% of polling booths.

The economy is perhaps the biggest issue, with farming in crisis, unemployment on the rise and fears growing that India is heading for a recession. A crop glut and declining commodity prices have led to stagnant farm incomes, leaving many farmers saddled with debt. Under Mr Modi, the world's sixth-largest economy has lost some of its momentum. Growth hovers around 7% and a leaked government report this year said the unemployment rate is the highest it has been since the 1970s.

{"global_context": "Virginia's embattled governor, Ralph Northam, capped a week of political chaos ignited by racial scandals by vowing to stay in office on Friday, while the fellow Democrat in line to succeed him faced a second accusation of sexual assault. RICHMOND, Va. (Reuters) - Virginia’s embattled governor, Ralph Northam, capped a week of political chaos ignited by racial scandals by vowing to stay in office on Friday, while the fellow Democrat in line to succeed him faced a second accusation of sexual assault. The swirling racial scandals, involving both Northam and the state’s Democratic attorney general, and the sexual assault accusations against the lieutenant governor have stirred fears about political fallout at both the state and the national level. Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax issued a statement denying both allegations and called them a “coordinated smear campaign.” He said the latest accusation, that he had raped a fellow student at Duke University in 2000, was “demonstrably false” and declared he would not step down. Fairfax, 39, insisted earlier this week that his encounter with a woman who has accused him of forcing himself on her sexually at a hotel in Boston in 2004 was entirely consensual. But Friday’s accusation sparked a round of calls for his resignation, and even the threat of impeachment. If Northam, Fairfax and the attorney general, Mark Herring, are all forced to resign it would mean that the next in line to become governor would be a Republican. That possibility has tested Democrats’ resolve to show zero tolerance for sexual misconduct and racial bigotry. It also has stirred Democrats’ concerns that political discord in Virginia, a key swing state in presidential elections, could flip back into the Republican column in the 2020 White House race. The upheaval began with the revelation last Friday that Northam’s medical school yearbook page contained a racist photo. That was followed by separate admissions from Northam, 59, and Herring, 57, that each had darkened their faces during the 1980s to imitate black performers, a practice widely considered to be racist. After a week hunkered down in virtual seclusion under mounting pressure to resign, Northam indicated in an email message on Friday to state employees that he planned to keep his post. “You have placed your trust in me to lead Virginia forward - and I plan to do that,” Northam said. In a separate statement responding to the latest allegation against him, Fairfax said he has “never forced myself on anyone ever” and demanded a “full investigation into these unsubstantiated and false allegations.” “I will clear my good name and I have nothing to hide,” Fairfax wrote, and declared: “I will not resign.” Fairfax had briefly seemed poised earlier this week to succeed Northam to become the second African-American governor in Virginia’s history. But the latest allegation of rape brought a torrent of demands for Fairfax to quit, including collective calls for his ouster from all Democrats in the state House of Delegates and Senate, and the state Legislative Black Caucus. One state House member, Democrat Patrick Hope, said on Twitter that he planned to introduce articles of impeachment for Fairfax on Monday unless he resigned before then. The woman who made the new accusation, identified as Meredith Watson, said she was “reluctantly coming forward out of a strong sense of civic duty and her belief that those seeking or serving in public office should be of the highest character,” the law firm that is representing her said in a statement. The firm, New Jersey-based Smith Mullin, said the alleged assault occurred in 2000. Watson is “not seeking any financial damages,” and her attorneys had notified Fairfax through his lawyers “that Ms. Watson hopes he will resign from public office,” the firm said in its statement. The Smith Mullin statement said the alleged attack on Watson “was premeditated and aggressive,” while also saying Fairfax and Watson “were friends but never dated or had any romantic relationship.” The law firm said Watson had “shared her account of the rape with friends in a series of emails and Facebook messages that are now in our possession.” Additionally, the firm said it possessed statements from former classmates corroborating that Watson had immediately told friends about the alleged rape. Fairfax’s first accuser, Stanford University academic Vanessa Tyson, has alleged that Fairfax had forced her to perform oral sex in a hotel room during the 2004 Democratic National Convention. Justin Fairfax, the Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, drinks before opening the state's Senate meeting during a session of the General Assembly in Richmond, Virginia, U.S, February 8, 2019. REUTERS/Jay Paul She came forward days after the disclosure by a conservative website of a racist photo on Northam’s 1984 yearbook page of two individuals - one in blackface and the other dressed in white robes of the Ku Klux Klan. Northam had originally admitted that he was one of the people in that photo, but later said that he was not. In an apparent effort at mending fences with Virginia’s African-American population, Northam on Friday met privately with the president and founder of the National Black Farmers Association, John Boyd Jr., in Richmond, the state capital. Boyd told Reuters the two men prayed together and “we asked for forgiveness.” Boyd, whose group says it represents 109,000 farmers across the country, said on Twitter afterward that he pledged his support to the governor and “urged him NOT to step down.”.

{"global_context": "Ted Cruz is facing an increasingly powerful challenge from Democrat Beto O’Rourke, and even some Republicans are saying he faces a tough challenge. Other Republicans dispute any suggestion that Mr. Cruz could lose. Texas, they argue, is not going to send a Democrat to the Senate. Some of its biggest cities are largely Democratic, but the suburbs and rural areas remain Republican, and Democratic voters’ history of low turnout has helped Republicans maintain their grip on power. In the Republican presidential primary in 2016, Mr. Cruz easily won Texas, earning 43 percent of the vote compared to Mr. Trump’s 26 percent. “Ted Cruz is not in trouble,” said Allen E. Blakemore, a Republican political consultant and the senior strategist for one of the most powerful conservatives in the state, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick. “Texas is a reliably red state and is going to continue to be for the foreseeable future. There is not a single statewide race that is in jeopardy.” If Mr. Cruz is in the fight of his political life, it was hard to see on Tuesday. “I didn’t give it much thought,” he said Tuesday when asked about Mr. Mulvaney’s comments. “I’m focused on what the people of Texas say. And we’re seeing incredible energy, incredible enthusiasm.” Mr. Cruz said he has been approached by voters who say they are Democrats but are supporting Mr. Cruz now. “With the election of Donald Trump, national Democrats are just consumed by rage and fury, and they’re embracing extreme positions, like Beto O’Rourke saying he’s open to abolishing ICE, or Beto O’Rourke committing that he would vote ‘yes’ to impeach Donald Trump,” Mr. Cruz said. “I am energetically welcoming conservative Democrats, moderate Democrats, independents.” Mr. Cruz’s campaign is getting a boost soon from Mr. Trump, his rival for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. Mr. Trump announced on Twitter that he was coming to Texas in October to host a “major rally” for Mr. Cruz. Democrats see it as a sign that Mr. Cruz’s campaign is struggling and needs rescuing. The trip seemed, in part, to be a response to a meeting in July in Washington between Texas leaders and Mr. Trump’s political staff. The July 25 meeting at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building was attended by Mr. Patrick, who was the Texas chairman of Mr. Trump’s campaign in 2016. Mr. Patrick and others were seeking to encourage Mr. Trump to campaign in Texas, according to a person who attended the meeting, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the meeting. The idea was not for Mr. Trump to come to the aid of Mr. Cruz, but for the president to boost Republican turnout to help the races farther down the ballot, the person said. On the surface, the prospect of Mr. Cruz campaigning with the president seems remarkable. Mr. Trump nicknamed Mr. Cruz Lyin’ Ted during the 2016 campaign, and attacked both his wife and his father. Mr. Cruz called Mr. Trump a “pathological liar” and “a sniveling coward.”.

(Czarek Sokolowski/Associated Press) WARSAW, Poland — The Latest on the diplomatic fallout over the nerve agent attack on an ex-Russian spy in Britain (all times local): 3:20 p.m. European Union chief Donald Tusk says 14 member nations are expelling Russian diplomatic staff over the poisoning of ex-spy Sergei Skripal in Britain. Tusk said Monday that there may be additional measures including further expulsions in the coming days and weeks. In coordinated announcements of expulsions on Monday, the Czech Republic said it is kicking out three staffers from the Russian embassy. Andrej Babis calls the measure an expression of solidarity with Britain. The Netherlands said it is expelling two Russian intelligence officers, while Estonia said it was expelling the Russian defense attache. The Italian Foreign Ministry announced that Italy would expel two Russian diplomats assigned to the embassy within a week __ 3:10 p.m. Poland, Germany and Lithuania are among the European countries announcing they are expelling Russian diplomats over the poisoning of Russian ex-spy in Britain. Germany and Poland both say they have asked four Russian diplomats to leave, while in Lithuania, three Russian diplomats were ordered to leave. The German foreign ministry said in a statement that the move was part of a joint European response to the Skripal case. It said “the expulsion of four diplomats is a strong signal of solidarity with Great Britain and signals the resolve of the Germany government not to leave attacks against our closest partners and allies unanswered.” The ministry added that the move was also a response to the recent cyberattacks against German government networks, “which according to information so far is highly likely to be attributable to Russian sources.” ___ 3 p.m. The United States is kicking out 60 Russian diplomats and ordering Russia’s consulate in Seattle to close in response to the poisoning of an ex-spy in Britain. Senior Trump administration officials say the expelled Russians include 12 spies who the U.S. believes are working under diplomatic cover at Russia’s mission to the United Nations. They say the Seattle consulate is a counter-intelligence concern because of its proximity to a U.S. Navy base. The officials say the actions are being taken to send a message about the “unacceptably high” number of Russian spies in the U.S. and to respond to the attack in the U.K. The officials weren’t authorized to be identified by name and requested anonymity. The expelled Russians will have seven days to leave the U.S. ___ 2:50 p.m. Lithuania’s foreign minister has strongly condemned the nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy in Britain, saying his country is poised to expel Russian diplomats in response. Linas Linkevicius said Monday “We have to do the utmost to show ... solidarity with our allies,” and to come up with “coordinated measures” as well as national measures. He said the attack was the first time after World War II that military chemical weapons were used on NATO, EU territory against civilians, adding these “methods... are not acceptable.” Asked whether the Baltic country would expel Russian diplomats, he said: “Lithuania will announce today national measures, including what you mentioned but not only that.” Romania’s Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu also expressed solidarity with Britain and said authorities would announce measures later. __ 2:40 p.m. Poland has summoned Russia’s ambassador for talks, and its foreign ministry is among several in Europe planning news conferences later Monday after EU chief Donald Tusk predicted that member states would introduce measures against Moscow over its suspected role in the spy poisoning case. Ambassador Sergei Andreev said details will be released by the Polish side later in the day. Foreign ministries in Denmark, Estonia and other EU countries are expected to announce measures to reporters. In the U.S., the White House is also expected to make a statement. Several EU countries said Friday they may follow Britain in expelling Russian diplomats in a deepening crisis over the nerve agent attack on an ex-Russian spy in England.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German police have detained three men suspected of involvement in an explosion that targeted an office of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) far-right party in the eastern state of Saxony. No one was injured in the explosion outside the AfD office in the city of Doebeln late on Thursday. The blast set the office on fire and damaged vehicles and nearby buildings, Saxony’s LKA criminal investigation office said in a statement. The LKA said its anti-terrorism unit had determined that the explosion was an escalation in politically motivated attacks targeting AfD offices in Saxony that are usually limited to acts of vandalism. “The attack against the AfD office in Doebeln is special given that the explosion was intended to harm people,” the LKA said. Saxony was the site of far-right riots and demonstrations sparked by the stabbing to death of a Cuban-German man in the city of Chemnitz in August, initially blamed on two migrants from Iraq and Syria. The riots, which featured skinheads performing the Hitler salute and chasing migrants in the streets of Chemnitz, highlighted the depth of a rift created by Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision in 2015 to welcome almost one million asylum seekers, mainly Muslims from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. Saxony has a large far-right scene. But it is also home to many supporters of the hard-left Die Linke, which is the second-largest party in the regional assembly.

{"global_context": "Shortly after President Barack Obama entered the White House in 2009, a group of citizens fed up with big government and excessive spending started a modern day Tea Party movement aimed at stopping a liberal political agenda. In the midterm of 2010, that Tea Party energy translated into votes. Republicans picked up 63 seats in the House of Representatives, the biggest wave election in at least a half century. In 2016, shortly after Donald Trump was elected, people on the other side of the political spectrum formed the Indivisible Project, a grassroots movement aimed at defeating the Trump agenda in favor of more progressive policies and leaders. To make that goal happen, Indivisible leaders borrowed some ideas from the Tea Party playbook — using on-the-ground outreach in everything from voter registration to helping people get to polls, small meet-up groups to maintain focus and discuss strategy, and plenty of emotion-driven enthusiasm at public events to rally voters toward their cause. With the midterm election looming, Democrats are hoping Indivisible’s efforts also will translate into votes. To get an idea of what both groups expect on Nov. 6 — and what they might have in common — we talked with Jenny Beth Martin, chief executive officer and co-founder of the national Tea Party Patriots, and Jiggy Athilingam, California state and local policy manager at the Indivisible Project. Q: How would you gauge excitement among voters? ATHILINGAM: I can speak more on the progressive base, but can tell you that all indications point to a huge surge of excitement… Midterms are known to be less exciting… but I think the progressive base really understands the importance of turning out to vote this year, more so than they have in the past. They’re watching what’s been happening in the federal government for the past almost two years and with the Supreme Court nominee (Brett Kavanaugh). They now see this is their chance to really put a check on the Republican controlled federal government…. MARTIN: (Tea Party) excitement for the 2018 midterm is increasing almost exponentially daily. I think that the energy, enthusiasm and concern about the direction of our country has been highlighted dramatically with the hearings about Brett Kavanaugh over the past couple of weeks, and we’ve seen an increase in requests for activism. Right now, we have more volunteers than we have supplies. What we’re seeing in the last few weeks, the importance of the Supreme Court is highlighted yet again. But on top of that, we’re looking at the foundational principals of our country being challenged; innocence until proven guilty and due process… Right now, what’s happening is more visceral and it’s emotional because (voters) are thinking, ‘Wait a minute. This can happen to me. It can happen to my son. It can happen to my husband. It can happen to my father. It can happen to my good friend who happens to be a man.’ For our organization, we are working to get the 2016 only Trump voters back out to the polls. We’ve identified 6.5 million of those voters in 85 different congressional and senate races, and we’re working to urge them to get back out and vote again. Q: What is the challenge facing Tea Party groups and conservative voters living in purple counties, such as San Bernardino County, or in blue areas of the country like in the Los Angeles area? Is it worth sticking it out and fighting, or should they move to more conservative parts of the country? Conversely, what are the challenges facing Indivisible members in red areas of the country? MARTIN: I think that as far as staying or leaving, a lot of times that winds up coming down to how the political policies are turned into legislation and how that ultimately affects an individual and a family’s pocket book… If it is preventing them from having the economic freedom and opportunity that they want in their life, they’re going to wind up moving where they can have a better life. That’s something that we’ve seen play out in California and in other states around the country… With that said, the people who are living in these purple and deep blue areas of the country, sometimes they’ll say to me that they’re just so frustrated, they feel alone, they’re not represented, and their members of Congress and even local elected officials just don’t listen to them. I urge those people to continue to stay involved and to make their voices heard even if they’re not getting the response that they want. Often times when the opposition is so in your face, which has happened especially in Hollywood and LA, it silences speech and I think that is not what we want. I live in an area of Georgia that’s the exact opposite of that. It’s a very, very conservative and Republican county and we have people who disagree with us, but they certainly, I don’t think, would come back and say they’re shamed into silence. They’re still part of our community. I think in California, especially, people who are conservative are treated much differently. ATHILINGAM: It’s amazing to meet the (Indivisible) groups that are in really red districts. So many of them will say ‘We didn’t realize there were other progressives here’ and now they have this new home for activism. That’s what I’m talking about when I talk about building community… They realize that they’re not alone in these really red districts. Building the progressive infrastructure that hasn’t existed in certain places before has a real possibility of revolutionizing things in redder areas. We talk a lot about the Ozark Arkansas Indivisible… They are in North West Arkansas and they are a very, very strong Indivisible group. That’s one example, but our groups in Alabama were extremely active during the Doug Jones election in December. Q: Since your group’s formation, how would you describe its influence on American politics? Where have they affected change? ATHILINGAM: It’s been honestly so beautiful to watch the Indivisible movement and, in general, the progressive movement, and how it’s risen to the occasion because of the catastrophe that’s happening in this country. We’ve been involved in really critical policy fights, worked on the (Affordable Care Act) repeal, worked on the Virginia elections and Virginia Medicaid, and groups have dabbled in different types of political activism over the past two years. But I think the most beautiful thing about the whole movement is not necessarily the wins… but just watching the constituency of America be engaged and come in to the political process in a way they haven’t been before. Democracy only works if people are engaged in it. MARTIN: I think it’s important to remember that really, the reason we started (the Tea Party) is because (CNBC on-air editor) Rick Santelli lit a match under us…. The rant he had on CNBC, which we all responded to, talked about how our founding fathers would be turning over in their graves over the Stimulus bill that was moving through (Congress). That was just a few months after (the Troubled Asset Relief Program), under President (George W.) Bush. But, our founding fathers would be turning over in their graves. We needed to have a Tea Party like they had. We’re holding the torch of freedom right now, but we didn’t start the Tea Party movement. We’re just continuing it the same way our forefathers did. So over the last decade, we’ve accomplished things and we still have more to do, but what I would say is the values we care about and the issues we fought for are largely the campaign issues that President Trump made central to his campaign…. The way Trump summed it up was so perfect; it was ‘draining the swamp.’ The swamp is the establishment of both parties, and he’s fighting against that. And that’s what we were fighting against as well… We’re still fighting the swamp. Q: Martin, would you say the election of Trump is a Tea Party Success? MARTIN: Our organization endorsed Ted Cruz in the primary. We did endorse Donald Trump when we got to the General Election, and we made two million phone calls and sent 100,000 cases of personalized mail to get out the vote in Pennsylvania and other states to help him win. We did more than 1 million phone calls in Pennsylvania in 2016. So yes, it is a success for the Tea Party movement. Q: Athilingam, how is the Indivisible movement capitalizing on President Donald Trump? ATHILINGAM: I think Trump’s actions are motivating people by themselves. Just his election caused the biggest march in our country, and a movement that sprung up out of nowhere. When Indivisible first started, our founders put out this guide that was supposed to be a document to give people advice on how to engage in Democracy. And we saw this giant movement bubble up. That wasn’t us capitalizing on anything; that was an original thing that happened because people are outraged and know this isn’t the country they believe in. (They’re) standing up for the values they believe in. It’s really President Trump that’s galvanizing the base of progressive voters because people are outraged and… don’t want to be complicit when our democracy is being torn down around them. Q: Martin, how has the Tea Party movement changed over the past 10 years? MARTIN: Quite dramatically. You can protest, and there are times when you feel like the only thing you can do is protest, and express yourself. And that’s the only way you can be engaged civically because your values are not in the majority. That happened to us back in 2009. But we realized that in order to actually have the change that we wanted, we were going to have to win elections. So we worked on elections. And then we made sure we didn’t just go away and say ‘Oh well, now that they’re elected, we can go back to life as usual.’ We kept holding their feet to the fire… The other thing is that we’ve found that there are still a lot of groups that are very, very active…. We’ve provided them with tools so that… they can take action right there and take action individually… Some of the actions that we take are a little bit different today than they were in the beginning. That is largely because we went from being completely in the minority to being the majority in congress. And with a Republican President, Donald Trump, in the White House, you go from defense to offense. Q: Athilingam, with the Tea Party now approaching its 10 year anniversary, do you see the Indivisible movement having a long lasting presence in American politics, too? Are there any similarities? ATHILINGAM: Yes, I absolutely think so. It’s interesting because the Tea Party was actually pretty small. There weren’t nearly as many people that were party of the Tea Party movement as are part of the Indivisible and broader progressive movement, yet they were able to do a lot. And it’s because they had good tactics. They were locally organized, they worked on pressuring their own elected representatives and holding them accountable. That’s part of where Indivisible actually came from. Leah Greenberg and Ezra Levin, who wrote the (Indivisible) guide, were congressional staffers during the rise of the Tea Party. And while what the Tea Party stands for is not everything we agree with, we’re strategically similar in their tactics… The reason I think this has the possibly of being long lasting is that when we talk to different groups, they might say they came to Indivisible because of Trump, but they’ve stayed because of the community it brought into (their) life. People come to Indivisible and want to do something because of the trash fire that’s happening in the federal government.

When the flag atop the White House was raised back to full-staff after just two days, outrage erupted. Veterans groups, including the American Legion, demanded a presidential proclamation honoring the former prisoner of war. Trump and McCain have had a history of mutual disdain, but the president eventually put their differences aside to issue a proclamation Monday afternoon honoring the late Republican senator and ordering flags at half-staff until McCain's burial. In his farewell letter, McCain said he \"lived and died a proud American.\" And he included a warning that we \"weaken our greatness when we confuse our patriotism with tribal rivalries,\" \"hide behind walls rather than tear them down\" and \"doubt the power of our ideals.\" More on the death of Sen.

Trump said the new agreement would be called the United States-Mexico trade agreement and that \"we’ll get rid of the name NAFTA,\" which has a \"bad connotation.\" But NAFTA is not dead yet.

The son, a public policy scholar and business executive who lived in Dubai and advocated improved relations between Iran and the United States, was arrested two years ago while visiting his family in Tehran. The father, a former Unicef diplomat, was arrested in February 2016 after the Iranian authorities had granted him permission to visit his son in Evin Prison, in Tehran. Both were denied access to legal representation, could not confront their accusers and have had health problems while imprisoned, Mr. Genser said. Both have been held in solitary confinement, the son has been tortured, and the father has a serious heart condition, he said.

The remedy, it said, was to release the Namazis “immediately and accord them an enforceable right to compensation and other reparations, in accordance with international law.” Mr. Genser said the opinion validated his assertion that “it is time for Iran to resolve these cases and allow the Namazis to be reunited with their family.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story The lawyer, who is based in Washington, said he received the opinion, dated Aug. 22, in a letter from the working group this month that urged him to treat it “with discretion.” The Iran government also received a copy.

Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. President Donald Trump’s campaign filed an arbitration complaint against Omarosa Manigault Newman on Tuesday, alleging that the former top White House aide was in breach of a 2016 confidentiality agreement, a Trump campaign official said. Trump’s campaign, formally named Donald J. Trump for President, took the action Tuesday against Manigault Newman with the American Arbitration Association in New York City, the official told NBC News. The action is related to claims made by Manigault Newman in her new book, \"Unhinged: An Insider's Account of the Trump White House,\" in which she slammed the president as racist and in mental decline. In the days leading up its Tuesday release, Manigault Newman has also publicly shared audio recordings made in the White House of Trump and of chief of staff John Kelly. In an arbitration proceeding, each side submits to the judgment of an independent arbitrator — typically a retired judge — who hears evidence presented by both sides and has the ability to make a ruling or penalize one side. Attorney John Phillips, who is representing Manigault Newman, said Tuesday afternoon that \"we haven't seen any legal action filed to date and don't have a comment on it.\" Manigault Newman, in an interview Monday with “PBS Newshour,” admitted she had signed non-disclosure agreements for her work on the Trump campaign as well as in 2003 after her work on “The Apprentice,” but said she had never signed one for her work in the White House. In an interview Tuesday afternoon with MSNBC's Katy Tur, Manigault Newman said, \"I don't believe I violated\" the campaign non-disclosure agreement. \"But I'll leave it to the lawyers,\" she said. She added that she felt it was \"interesting he's trying to silence me.\" \"What is he afraid of?\" Manigault Newman said. \"If he hadn't said anything derogatory about African-Americans ... then why would he go to this extent to shut me down?\" White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, asked during a press briefing Tuesday about the campaign's arbitration action and whether the White House might pursue similar action, said she \"wouldn't be able to comment on any ongoing legal matter.\" In her book, Manigault Newman wrote that she had not signed a non-disclosure agreement for her work in the White House. She asserted in the book that within 24 hours of her departure, Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law, emailed her a contract to work on the president's re-election campaign for $15,000 per month, in exchange for signing a nondisclosure agreement that was \"as harsh and restrictive as any I'd seen in all my years of television.\" Manigault Newman wrote that she turned down the offer. She provided what she said were copies of those agreements to NBC's \"Meet the Press” on Sunday. Trump tweeted Monday that \"Wacky Omarosa already has a fully signed Non-Disclosure Agreement!\" It was unclear whether that remark was in reference to Manigault Newman’s non-disclosure agreement for her work on the campaign.

A new poll finds that pop star Taylor Swift’s endorsement of Phil Bredesen in Tennessee’s Senate race has done little to move the dial in the Democrat’s direction. The poll by Republican polling firm Cygnal finds that 86 percent of voters said their choice has not changed after Taylor Swift broke her decade-long practice of staying away from politics to publicly endorse Bredesen. Indeed, 82 percent of respondents said that they were aware of Swift’s endorsement. “Millennial and Gen Z voters are highly aware of the endorsement of the Democrat, but it did little to move their vote preference,” said Matt Hubbard, VP of Research & Analytics at Cygnal. “Swift’s endorsement is providing a boost to get-out-the-vote efforts, but we’re seeing minimal impact on the race.” The poll of likely voters under the age of 35 still shows an advantage for the Democrat with 50 percent of respondents saying they will probably vote for Democrat Bredesen and only 36 percent choosing Republican Marsha Blackburn. Ten percent of young voters are still undecided. But of those who admitted that the Taylor Swift endorsement swayed their vote, the result was nearly identical either way. Five percent said Swift convinced them to vote for the Democrat while six percent said they jumped into the Republican camp because of the “Shake It Off” singer’s announcement. Cygnal President and Founder Brent Buchanan noted that Swift’s sudden jump into politics “may lead to ‘Bad Blood’ with her conservative fans.” Meanwhile, polls are better for Blackburn in the state overall. At three weeks out from Election Day, Blackburn is at plus 5.5 percent in the state overall, according to the Real Clear Politics polling average. Still, the state is considered a “toss-up,” but Blackburn’s poll numbers have climbed, and Bredesen has fallen despite Swift’s endorsement of the Democrat. For her part, Blackburn said that Tennesseans don’t much care about the opinion of pop stars. “Tennesseans are more interested in the fact that Marsha Blackburn is endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, by the Fraternal Order of Police, by the Police Benevolent Association and by the National Rifle Association, where I have an ‘A’ rating and their endorsement,” Blackburn said.

{"global_context": "A Senate investigation into President Donald Trump's possible connections to Russia has revealed a possible obstruction of justice case against the president. WASHINGTON — A Senate investigation into Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election has revealed a possible obstruction of justice case against President Donald Trump, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein said on \"Meet The Press\" Sunday. \"The [Senate] Judiciary Committee has an investigation going as well and it involves obstruction of justice and I think what we're beginning to see is the putting together of a case of obstruction of justice,” Feinstein, the panel's top Democrat, said.

Also charged in connection to the Mueller investigation are Trump's former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, who both pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. \"I see it in the hyper-frenetic attitude of the White House, the comments every day, the continual tweets. And I see it most importantly in what happened with the firing of Director [James] Comey, and it is my belief that that is directly because he did not agree to ‘lift the cloud’ of the Russia investigation. That’s obstruction of justice,” Feinstein said. Trump fired former FBI Director James Comey earlier this year in the midst of the bureau's investigation into Russia's interference into the 2016 presidential election. The Senate Judiciary Committee is conducting just one of a number of congressional investigations that touch the fallout from Russia’s alleged election interference, including active probes in both the Senate and House Intelligence Committees.

Court documents showed that Flynn was urged by two transition officials to contact Russians, and sources have told NBC News that those officials are Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, and K.T. McFarland, who later served as deputy national security adviser in the White House. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who is also a member of the Senate’s Intelligence Committee, said in an interview Sunday it’s still unclear whether or not there was any form of collusion between Russians and people in Trump’s orbit. The conversations between Flynn and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the transition “should not have been taking place,” Collins said, since there was only one president at he time, President Obama. “But that does not confirm collusion.\" Collins added that she would still like to hear from Flynn because she believes “he could contribute a great deal to our investigation,” but Flynn has declined their invitations, citing the Fifth Amendment. Collins said their committee does not have access to the interview transcripts in Mueller’s probe.

The president should have no comment whatsoever on either of these investigations,\" she said. “The only thing he should be doing is directing all of his staff and his associates to fully cooperate.” Feinstein on Sunday also noted that her concern about the White House “rises with the day.” Asked specifically whether her concern with President Trump’s ability to do the job rises by the day, she responded, “oh yes,” and added that a moment came a month ago where she felt enough is enough. But Feinstein did not go as far as saying there’s a need to remove Trump from office yet. “I believe it’s time for us to finish our investigation and I don’t want to bias any part of the investigation with premature thinking,” she said. “I think that’s very important.”.

{"global_context": "Mr. Kelly, the new chief of staff and a retired Marine general, is seeking to calm the chaotic churn around the president but not to directly control his behavior. Mr. Kelly’s predecessor, Reince Priebus, sent some similar guidelines around early in the administration, according to two officials, but they were never taken seriously. Mr. Kelly, a retired Marine general, has been treated with a different level of deference inside the building, those aides said. Staff members discovered early on that they could defy Mr. Priebus, the officials said, but crossing a Marine is a different matter. Mr. Kelly has made clear that one thing he will not seek to directly control is the behavior of the president, and there is a good reason for that. Mr. Trump has a history of lashing out at advisers who have publicly conveyed their attempts to impose tighter procedures on him. Just before Election Day, for example, Mr. Trump blew up publicly after a New York Times report that his aides had succeeded in keeping him off Twitter for the final stages of the campaign. He tweeted several times to enforce the point. Despite Mr. Kelly’s fairly deft touch at approaching the president, Mr. Trump has shown signs of rebelling after stories have appeared describing how his chief of staff has put tighter controls in place and is imposing some discipline on White House operations. That included his news conference at Trump Tower in which he doubled down on his blame for “both sides” in the racially charged violence in Charlottesville, Va., and his campaign rally speech in Arizona on Tuesday when he accused the news media of mischaracterizing his statements. Mr. Kelly had urged Mr. Trump to deliver a more somber, traditional statement the day before. And he and other advisers had urged the president to avoid taking questions from the news media at Trump Tower, a request that the president ignored. Before Mr. Trump’s rally in Arizona, aides prepared a sober set of remarks for him to deliver about unity, and sought to redirect his focus after he learned of a Times report about his relationship with Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader. Mr. Trump, who trusts few people and adjusts to new advisers gradually, railed at his new chief of staff over the story, according to one person close to the president. Still, the memos have brought comfort to a number of Mr. Trump’s advisers who have sought structure in a Wild West environment. And they have provided guardrails where few existed. “General Kelly is instilling processes to ensure that the president has the information and analysis he needs to make decisions,” said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The memos were follow-ups to themes that Mr. Kelly touched on during a conference call with senior staff members in which he went through a menu of items related to how the president receives information, how he makes decisions, how meetings with him are scheduled, and how speeches are scheduled and written. Photo The effect so far has been, at times, a more pronounced split-screen between the president’s public behavior and his staff’s more structured approach. But inside the West Wing, several aides said they felt more protected by an established process. In one of the memos, White House aides were told that all materials prepared for the president must go first to Mr. Porter for vetting and clearance. Then Mr. Kelly must sign off on them before they go to Mr. Trump’s desk. That includes news articles, according to West Wing officials who described the memos’ content — of particular importance, given the propensity for some of Mr. Trump’s staff to slip him news accounts from dubious sources that shape his thinking or prompt him to cite unreliable or inaccurate information. The process for documents with legal implications is somewhat more rigorous, although a version of it has been in place since Mr. Priebus was chief of staff.

For instance, the draft of an executive order will go through several stages of development, involving the White House Counsel’s Office and vetting by relevant staff and agency officials. Then it will go to Mr. Kelly for final approval before it is given to the president. Mr. Priebus had tried to take firmer control of that process after Mr. Trump’s first week in office, when Stephen K. Bannon, the recently departed chief strategist, and Stephen Miller, the president’s senior policy adviser, pushed across the president’s desk two orders redesigning the National Security Council, and putting in place the first, court-contested travel ban on seven predominantly Muslim countries. In the second memo, Mr. Kelly and Mr. Porter set up a system for deciding policy issues that have a legal aspect, such as executive orders, to ensure that all sides of the issue are heard. All decisions made in meetings will be formalized in memos, and they are to follow the process of approval by first Mr. Porter and then Mr. Kelly. That process is expected to curtail freelancing and hijacking of decisions by West Wing aides. Mr. Bannon was often accused of taking advantage of the loose process, but Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his daughter, Ivanka Trump, who both work in the West Wing, have also frustrated their colleagues for months by going directly to the president on specific issues. On Mr. Kelly’s first day on the job, he held a small meeting with top aides to the president after a fuller staff meeting. He told them that Oval Office access to Mr. Trump, which was once nearly universal to people coming through the West Wing, would be strictly limited to appointments only. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The exceptions, Mr. Kelly said, were the president’s wife and his 11-year-old son. And, he added, turning to Ivanka Trump, who was seated near him, the president’s eldest daughter, if she was speaking to him as a daughter and not a member of his staff. Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump quickly gave in to Mr. Kelly’s new system, two White House officials said. Since Mr. Trump returned from a working vacation at his golf club in New Jersey, the newly renovated West Wing has taken on a more formal air. Not only is the door to the Oval Office closed, preventing passers-by from catching the president’s eye, but a corridor door leading to the president’s office has also been kept closed. Mr. Trump, who often complained about Mr. Priebus, appears to have absorbed the need for one person to run the staff. The changes Mr. Kelly has put in place have resulted in a more streamlined, functional government, administration officials said. But Mr. Trump, presidential experts say, has shown he is immune to efforts to bring lasting change to his own behavior. And that could ultimately undermine Mr. Kelly’s mission. “Let’s assume for the moment that Trump has learned the first big lesson of his first six months, which is that you have to empower the White House chief of staff to be a real gatekeeper,” said Chris Whipple, author of “The Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency.” “What he hasn’t learned, what he has shown no sign of learning, is that governing is completely different from campaigning,” Mr. Whipple said.

(Photo: Brynn Anderson, AP) WASHINGTON – Alabama Republican Roy Moore says a lawsuit will be filed over the newspaper report carrying allegations that he had sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl four decades ago and that neither Democrats nor Republicans want to see him win a special Senate election. While pressure to quit the race four weeks before Election Day intensified from within the Republican Party, Moore assured supporters Sunday night at a Huntsville, Alabama, gym that the Washington Post story was “fake news” and “a desperate attempt to stop my political campaign.” Moore said allegations that he was involved with a minor child are “untrue” and said the newspaper “will be sued,” drawing a round of applause. The former judge also questioned why such allegations would be leveled for the first time so close to the special election in spite of his decades in public life. “Why would they come now? Because there are groups that don’t want me in the United States Senate,” he said, naming the Democratic Party and the Republican establishment and accusing them of working together. He added, “We do not plan to let anybody deter us from this race.” The Post story quoted four women by name, including the woman who alleged the sexual contact at 14, and had two dozen other sources. Roy Moore greets supporters at an election-night rally after declaring victory on Sept. 26, 2017, in Montgomery, Ala. (Photo: Scott Olson, Getty Images) Moore also tried to raise money from the controversy, writing in a fundraising pitch sent about midafternoon that the “vicious and sleazy attacks against me are growing more vicious by the minute.” He told supporters, “I’m counting on you to stand with me at this critical moment by chipping in a donation to help me bust through the vicious lies and attacks and get the truth out to as many voters as possible before December 12.” Another fellow Republican, Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, urged Moore to drop out of the race. He said Moore’s explanations had been inadequate and that Republicans should consider Sen. Luther Strange as a write-in candidate to run against Moore. Strange lost the Republican primary to Moore in September. Even if Moore were to step aside, his name would likely remain on the ballot. And any effort to add Strange as a write-in candidate would threaten to divide the GOP vote in a way that would give the Democratic candidate a greater chance of winning. Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey told NBC’s Meet the Press that Roy Moore should “step aside.\" Toomey did not rule out the possibility that Senate Republicans might work to unseat Moore if he wins the special election against Democrat Doug Jones. “You know, this is a terrible situation, nearly 40-year-old allegation, we’ll probably never know for sure exactly what happened,” Toomey said on “Meet the Press” on NBC. “But from my point of view, I think the accusations have more credibility than the denial. I think it would be best if Roy would just step aside.” The White House, pointedly noting that President Donald Trump did not back Moore during the primary, said Trump will likely weigh in on the Senate race when he returns from Asia later this week. The White House has already made clear that Moore should step aside if the allegations are proven to be true. “I think there’s a special place in hell for those who actually perpetrate these crimes,” White House legislative aide Marc Short said Sunday. “But, having said that, he hasn’t been proved guilty,” Short added. “We have to afford him the chance to defend himself.” Moore is an outspoken Christian conservative and former state Supreme Court judge. The Post reported last Thursday that he had sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl and pursued three other teenagers decades earlier. While he called the allegations “completely false and misleading,” in an interview with conservative radio host Sean Hannity he did not wholly rule out dating teenage girls when he was in his early 30s. Asked if that would have been usual for him, Moore said, “Not generally, no.” Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Several companies have pulled their advertisements from Fox News host Sean Hannity's show following his interview with Alabama Republican senate candidate Roy Moore on Friday. USA TODAY The story stirred concern among anxious GOP officials in Washington in a key race to fill the Senate seat once held by Jeff Sessions, now the U.S. attorney general. Losing the special election to a Democrat would imperil Republicans’ already slim 52-48 majority in the Senate, which is hoping to pass a tax overhaul later this year. But a Moore victory also would pose risks if he were to join the Senate GOP with a cloud of sexual misconduct allegations. In the immediate aftermath of the Post report, a wave of national Republican leaders called for Moore to drop out of the race if the allegations are true.

Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum will win the Democratic nomination for governor of Florida, CNN projects, scoring a major victory for the party's progressive wing while taking another step toward becoming the state's first black chief executive. Backed by Bernie: Backed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and a coalition of progressive groups, Gillum upset former Rep. Gwen Graham who led in the polls for most of the campaign.

As the primary neared, progressive groups — Indivisible Action, The Collective PAC, The New Florida Vision PAC and the Sanders-inspired Our Revolution among them — banded together to invest an additional $3.5 million in get out the vote efforts supporting Gillum, who campaigned as an outspoken critic of the state's controversial \"Stand Your Ground\" gun law, which he said at a protest earlier this month \"has no place in a civilized society.\" In a statement Tuesday night, Sanders cheered Gillum's \"vision\" and cast Gillum as a leader in the broader progressive movement: \"No one person can take on the economic and political elites on their own.

{"global_context": "Republicans are rebuking Romney. But they’re not saying he was wrong about Trump’s character. Two years ago, the Republican Party struck a bargain with President Trump: It would look past his many shenanigans in exchange for Supreme Court justices, tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks. Republicans might offer the occasional, mild critique, but they’ve largely stood by the president — even at his most controversial. They need him to get stuff done. This not-so-grand bargain has rarely been so obvious as since the publication of Mitt Romney’s op-ed. In his piece, Romney offered no real policy differences with Trump; in fact, the senator from Utah has actually endorsed things like the border wall. Instead, he took Trump to task for a character deficiency. Trump, Romney argued, “has not risen to the mantle of the office.” Since the piece came out Tuesday night, Republicans have rallied around the president and rebuked Romney. What’s telling though: No one is really saying Romney is wrong in criticizing Trump’s core. Rather than take issue with that conclusion, Trump’s most vocal defenders are arguing that it’s simply not that important in the grand scheme of things. The most high-profile example came from Romney’s own niece, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel. In a tweet Wednesday, she wrote: “For an incoming Republican freshman senator to attack @realdonaldtrump as their first act feeds into what the Democrats and media want and is disappointing and unproductive.” POTUS is attacked and obstructed by the MSM media and Democrats 24/7. For an incoming Republican freshman senator to attack @realdonaldtrump as their first act feeds into what the Democrats and media want and is disappointing and unproductive. https://t.co/ArhI7Bi7bo — Ronna McDaniel (@GOPChairwoman) January 2, 2019 Former House speaker Newt Gingrich took to Fox News to echo that Romney should back off — because he can’t beat Trump anyway. Mitt Romney is a freshman Senator. He can't take on President @realDonaldTrump and win. He should be focused on solving problems for our country — not trying to create conflicts within his own party. pic.twitter.com/xxQtdn3EQ8 — Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) January 3, 2019 Former Bush White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said Romney should train his fire on Democrats rather than the Republican president. “If Senator-elect Romney thinks Trump is a bigger problem than Nancy Pelosi or Senator Schumer, then he has a lot to learn about how things get done in Washington,” Fleischer said. And in a Washington Post op-ed, conservative writer Henry Olsen suggested that Romney was hurting the Republican cause. “Romney would like you to believe you can have your cake and eat it, too — that you can be against Trump’s character but for his policies,” Olsen writes. “But that doesn’t work in the real world. Railing about character hurts the president, and Republicans know that.” You’ll note that none of these defenses actually vouch for Trump’s character or say Romney was wrong. Instead, they’re admitting this is all about pragmatism and teamwork. They’re saying that the goals of the Republican Party matter more than the quality of the president’s person. McDaniel and Gingrich both diminish Romney as a freshman senator, suggesting he’s out of line to question Trump. The irony is especially thick here with Gingrich, who literally built his political career as a backbencher taking on and defeating more powerful and senior politicians, including in his own party. Fleischer and Olsen both prop up straw men, suggesting Romney is ranking Trump’s character too high on his list of priorities. Fleischer suggests that Romney said Trump is a bigger problem than Democrats. (Romney never said that.) Olsen writes that “the article’s premise [is] that President Trump’s character is more important than his accomplishments or principles.” (Romney also never said this.) The combined argument seems to be that you shouldn’t say things that hurt your team and that you shouldn’t criticize something if there is something else that is a bigger problem. But that leaves almost no room to say anything, short of utter, imminent disaster. Maybe Romney thinks the Democrats are also a big problem and that Trump’s policies are great, but that character is also important and should be addressed? Perhaps he recognizes that lots of Republicans praise Trump’s wins and attacks on Democrats, but believe there is a dearth of Republicans willing to raise this important issue? Those very logical arguments aren’t countenanced by the most prominent defenses of Trump. Instead, leading voices in the GOP seem to be arguing that tribalism is the end goal — that the ends justify the means. The party of values and morality is increasingly arguing that such ideals are mere speed bumps on the way to conservative policy goals. And they’re saying it publicly. What might be most notable, though, is what they’re not saying: that anything Romney wrote about Trump’s character is wrong.

{"global_context": "In a wide-ranging speech to conservatives, the president pushed for to arm some teachers and end gun-free zones in schools. WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Friday criticized the armed school guard who failed to stop the shooting in Florida as the president pushed to permit some teachers to carry guns and end gun-free zones. \"He didn't turn out to be too good, I'll tell you that,\" Trump said at the Conservative Political Action Conference, calling the guard \"not a credit to law enforcement.\" The armed sheriff's deputy, Scot Peterson, who was on site during the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, last week, resigned after being suspended without pay. He took cover outside the school rather than trying to enter the building and stop the shooter. Later in the day Friday, during a joint press conference with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Trump called Peterson's decision to stay outside \"not his finest moment\" and said the guard didn't \"love the children.\" Teachers, on the other hand, Trump said, \"love their children\" and would move to protect them in situations of crisis. Trump also repeated his call to arm teachers, explaining why he thinks that would prevent mass school killings. \"This crazy man who walked in wouldn't even know who it is that has (a gun), that’s good. It's not bad, that's good,\" Trump told conservatives gathered in National Harbor, Md. \"And a teacher would've shot the hell out of him before he knew what happened.\" \"When we declare our schools to be 'gun free zones' it just puts our students in far more danger,\" he said.

But midway through the address, he told the crowd his prepared remarks were \"a little boring — you don't mind if I go off script a little bit?\" That led to a riff about the president's bald spot, chants from the crowd about Hillary Clinton to \"lock her up!\" and a dramatic reading of one of Trump's campaign staples — the rock song-turned-immigration-rallying cry, \"The Snake.\" The crowd — conservatives with generally positive attitudes toward the National Rifle Association and the Second Amendment — applauded the idea of some gun-carrying teachers and school officials, even as experts have balked at the president's proposal. \"I don’t want a person that's never handled a gun, that wouldn't know what a gun looks like,\" Trump said of his plan. Earlier this week, Trump also floated the idea of small bonuses for those teachers or school officials willing to carry guns. Speaking of the former student who took the lives of 17 students and teachers in Parkland last week, Trump said that \"if he thought that other people would be shooting back at him, he wouldn't have gone to that school.\" A day after National Rifle Association CEO Wayne LaPierre criticized background checks at CPAC, the president made the case for strengthening them: \"We don't want people that are mentally ill to be having any form of weaponry.\" While Trump also has advocated raising the age of purchase from 18 to 21 years of age for semi-automatic weapons — which the NRA doesn't support — he did not mention that idea on Friday at CPAC. The changes he hopes to make to improve school safety are \"just common sense,\" Trump told the crowd. \"It's not, 'Do you love guns, do you hate guns?' It's common sense. It's all common sense.\" President Donald Trump speaks during the 2018 CPAC at National Harbor in Oxon Hill, Maryland on Feb. 23, 2018. Saul Loeb / AFP - Getty Images But Trump also knew his audience. He made clear that despite wanting to move forward and make changes to certain aspects of gun laws, \"there’s nobody that loves the Second Amendment more than I do, and there's nobody that respects the NRA, they're friends of mine.\" Before addressing school safety measures, the president warned the crowd that electing Democrats would mean waving goodbye to the newly enacted tax cuts passed by Republicans late last year, as well as seeing their Second Amendment rights taken away. \"If you only had a choice of one, which would you rather have?\" Trump asked, \"The Second Amendment or the tax cuts?\" In polling the crowd — a favorite move of Trump's from his days on the 2016 campaign trail — keeping Second Amendment rights won more cheers. \"I'm gonna leave it at the Second Amendment,\" Trump decided. \"I don't want to get into that battle, all right?\" It became clear early on that the president's scripted remarks could become a casualty of the friendly conservative crowd that he was clearly enjoying. When Trump seemed to catch a glimpse of himself in a nearby television monitor — \"What a nice picture that is,\" he remarked — he paused to coif his hair. \"I try like hell to hide that bald spot folks, I work hard,\" Trump teased, moving his hands over his famous blond hair. \"Doesn't look bad? Hey, we're hanging in. ... Together, we’re hanging in.\" As he crossed the hour mark in his remarks, Trump had energized the crowd about the need for Republicans to mobilize in 2018 and lamented that Democrats had \"totally abandoned\" him on solving DACA. \"They don’t even talk to me about it!\" Trump said.

SYDNEY — An Australian man sent his unsuspecting brother to Sydney airport to catch an Etihad Airways flight carrying a home-made bomb disguised as a meat mincer built at the direction of a senior ISIS commander, police said on Friday. Detailing one of Australia's worst known militant plots, police said two men who have been charged with terror-related offences also planned to build a device to release poisonous gas in a public area. Police walk past passengers as they patrol Sydney Airport on Sunday. William West / AFP - Getty Images file High-grade military explosives used to build the bomb were sent by air cargo from Turkey as part of a sophisticated plot \"inspired and directed\" by the militant Islamic State group, Australian Federal Police Deputy Commissioner National Security Michael Phelan said. He said the plot targeted an Etihad Airways flight on July 15 but that the bomb never made it past airport security. \"This is one of the most sophisticated plots that has ever been attempted on Australian soil,\" Phelan said. Police allege that one of the two men charged late on Thursday had been introduced to Islamic State by his brother, who they said was a senior member of the group in Syria. Communication between the accused man and Islamic State began around April. Under the instruction of the unidentified Islamic State commander, the men built a \"fully functioning IED\" (improvised explosive device). One of the arrested men's brother was unaware that he was carrying a bomb, disguised as a commercial meat mincer, in his luggage, and tried to check it in at the airport, police said. \"We'll be alleging that the person who was to carry the IED on the plane had no idea they were going to be carrying an IED,\" Phelan said. “ This is one of the most sophisticated plots that has ever been attempted on Australian soil” There was \"a little bit of conjecture\" about what happened next, he said, but it appeared one of the accused then left the airport, taking the luggage with him. The man's brother boarded the plane and has not since returned to Australia. \"I want to make it quite clear — it never got near screening. I don't want anyone to suggest that it ... penetrated airport security layers ... because it did not. It didn't go anywhere near it,\" Phelan said. Etihad said in a statement on Friday it had been working closely with the Australian Federal Police investigation. Police arrested four men last weekend in raids across Sydney, Australia's biggest city. One man has been released, while another is still being held without charge under special counter-terror laws. Domestic media have identified the two men who have been charged as Khaled Khayat and Mahmoud Khayat, who each face two counts of planning a terrorist act. The charges carry a maximum punishment of life in prison. Police search for evidence at a block of apartment on Sunday in the Sydney suburb of Lakemba, after counter-terrorism raids across the city on the weekend. William West / AFP - Getty Images file The men did not apply for bail at a court hearing on Friday, a spokeswoman for New South Wales Courts said, and bail was formally denied. Their next scheduled court appearance is on Nov. 14. U.S. officials, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said this week a foreign intelligence service had intercepted communications between the plotters in Sydney and Islamic State members in Syria. The officials declined to identify the foreign intelligence service. Another U.S. official said the flight was bound for the Gulf. Police also said they had uncovered the early stages of a plot to build an \"improvised chemical dispersion device\" designed to release hydrogen sulphide gas. Precursor chemicals and other components were found but the accused were \"a long way\" from making a functioning device. Foul-smelling hydrogen sulphide, or \"rotten egg gas,\" is deadly in high concentrations. Police said \"preliminary and hypothetical\" discussions between the accused and Islamic State suggested a plan to deploy it in a crowded place, such as public transport. Australia, a staunch U.S. ally that has sent troops to Afghanistan and Iraq, has been on heightened alert since 2014 for attacks by home-grown militants returning from fighting in the Middle East, or their supporters. While there have been several \"lone wolf\" attacks, officials say 13 significant plots have been foiled in that time. A gunman in a 2014 Sydney cafe siege boasted about links with Islamic State militants, although no direct ties with the group were established.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will hold a second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un around the end of February but will maintain sanctions on Pyongyang, the White House said on Friday after Trump met Pyongyang’s top nuclear negotiator. The announcement came amid a diplomatic flurry in Washington surrounding the visit of Kim Yong Chol, a hardline former spy chief, and marked a rare sign of movement in a denuclearization effort that has stalled since a landmark meeting between Trump and the North Korean leader in Singapore last year. “President Donald J. Trump met with Kim Yong Chol for an hour and (a) half, to discuss denuclearization and a second summit, which will take place near the end of February. The President looks forward to meeting with Chairman Kim at a place to be announced at a later date,” White House spokesman Sarah Sanders said. Sanders insisted, however, that while progress was being made, the United States “is going to continue to keep pressure and sanctions on North Korea.” Despite the summit announcement, there has been no indication of any narrowing of differences over U.S. demands that North Korea abandon a nuclear weapons program that threatens the United States or over Pyongyang’s repeated demands for a lifting of punishing sanctions. Trump declared after the Singapore summit in June that the nuclear threat posed by North Korea was over. But hours before Kim Yong Chol’s arrival on Thursday, Trump unveiled a revamped U.S. missile defense strategy that singled out the country as an ongoing and “extraordinary threat.” The first summit produced a vague commitment by Kim to work toward the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, but he has yet to take what Washington sees as concrete steps in that direction. Nevertheless, both Trump and Kim had expressed an interest in arranging a second summit, which some U.S.-based analysts say would be premature due to the lack of obvious progress so far. Communist-ruled Vietnam, which has good relations with both the United States and North Korea, has been widely touted as the most likely site of the next summit. There has also been speculation about other possible venues, including Bangkok, Hawaii or a return to Singapore. Friday’s Oval Office meeting followed 45 minutes of talks between the North Korean envoy and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Slideshow (6 Images) The State Department said that Pompeo had a “good discussion” with Kim Yong Chol “on efforts to make progress on commitments President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un made at their summit in Singapore.” It provided no specifics. Harry Kazianis, an analyst at the Washington-based Center for the National Interest, said: “Both nations must now show at least some tangible benefits from their diplomatic efforts during a second summit, or risk their efforts being panned as nothing more than reality TV.”.

{"global_context": "Christine Hallquist made history in Vermont Tuesday night as the first openly transgender nominee for a governorship from a major party in the nation's history, beating back her Democratic challengers in the state's primary. Christine Hallquist made history in Vermont Tuesday night as the first openly transgender nominee for a governorship from a major party in the nation's history, beating back her Democratic challengers in the state's primary. Hallquist defeated educator Brenda Siegel, who earlier was considered a frontrunner in the race, and environmentalist James Ehlers. On the Republican side, first-term Gov. Phil Scott overcame businessman Keith Stern to win the GOP gubernatorial primary, surviving the major political fallout from his decision to sign the state's first major gun control laws earlier this year. Hallquist, a former CEO of the Vermont Electric Cooperative, made no bones about the fact she wanted a place in the history books during the campaign. She's appealed to Vermonters with a progressive message including a livable wage, Medicare for all, free public college education and high-speed broadband access — even to those who live on remote back roads. \"That's how I want to be known in Vermont,\" Hallquist, 62, told The Associated Press in an interview at her Burlington offices. \"Nationally, I want to be known as the first trans candidate.\" Hallquist also defeated another candidate who was trying to make history: a 14-year-old boy, Ethan Sonneborn, who took advantage of the state constitution's lack of an age requirement to seek the governorship. But Hallquist faces long odds in November. No sitting governor has been defeated in Vermont since 1962, and Scott's victory would continue Republicans' surprisingly strong hold on governorships in highly progressive New England. The GOP currently holds the governorships of four out of six states in the region, including Vermont, Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. However, Scott may have a unique vulnerability. In April, he was heckled by a bevy of protesters calling him a \"liar\" and \"traitor\" as he signed sweeping gun regulations into law, citing the dangers posed by mass shootings. The package of bills raised the age to buy firearms from 18 to 21, banned high-capacity magazines, and made it easier to take guns from people considered a danger to themselves or others and from people arrested or cited for domestic assault. Scott's approval rating in the state tanked after he signed the measure, plummeting from 65 percent early in the year to 47 percent shortly after the bill took effect. His disapproval rating nearly doubled to 42 percent in that period. WATCH: PRO-GUN PROTESTERS HECKLE 'TRAITOR' VERMONT GOVERNOR Some results are still pending in Tuesday's other major gubernatorial primaries, including in Wisconsin, Connecticut and Minnesota. Businessman Ned Lamont won the Democratic nomination for Connecticut governor, defeating Bridgeport mayor and ex-convict Joe Ganim. Connecticut is ground-zero for Republican efforts Tuesday to continue their gains in deeply progressive New England. Even though Connecticut voted for Hillary Clinton by double-digits in 2016, the state's governor, Dan Malloy, is deeply unpopular, with critics citing high taxes and an ongoing budget crisis. Malloy declined to seek a third term. Danbury Mayor Mark Boughton, former First Selectman Tim Herbst, businessman Steve Obsitnik, former investment banker Bob Stefanowski and former hedge fund manager David Stemerman are the Republicans looking to succeed him. They have disagreed on key issues, such as whether to eliminate the state's income tax. Meanwhile, in Minnesota, Tim Pawlenty -- who briefly ran for president in 2012 -- is hoping to stage a political comeback and become Minnesota’s governor again, in a race to replace outgoing Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton that Fox News considers a tossup. And in Wisconsin, Democrats are making yet another effort to unseat Republican Scott Walker, a well-known union buster who is seeking a third term. A bevy of Democrats with some high-profile endorsements are competing for the right to take him on in November. The states are also holding key House and Senate races, as Democrats pick their candidate to try to flip retiring Rep. Paul Ryan's seat, and Republicans hope to make gains in the House in Minnesota.

Grant and Christopher Columbus?The short answer is: “It. Ulysses Grant’s Tomb in New York. (Getty Images) How did we go, less than a week after racist violence in Charlottesville, Va., from removing statues of Robert E. Lee to talking about obliterating edifices honoring Ulysses S. Grant and Christopher Columbus? The short answer is: “It’s human nature.” But I’ll amplify. “Disasters should not be politicized — it’s about people’s lives and getting their lives rebuilt,” New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was telling Fox News anchor Neil Cavuto the other day. Christie wasn’t talking about the man-made mayhem in Virginia. He was talking about Hurricane Harvey. Yet in the next breath, he settled old scores against Texas senators and congressmen who voted against Hurricane Sandy relief. Christie has a point. And politicizing disasters, whether natural or human-created, has long been a national pastime. This is not always a bad thing. A 1910 forest fire in Washington, Idaho, and Montana — so massive it was called “the Big Burn” — was used by Theodore Roosevelt to create the National Forest Service. The famous 1871 fire that leveled Chicago forever altered the look, politics and character of the Windy City. Chicago’s current mayor, Rahm Emanuel, put it this way after becoming incoming President Obama’s chief of staff: “You never want a serious crisis to go to waste. And what I mean by that is an opportunity to do things that you think you could not do before.” Emanuel cited the squandered chance at promulgating a broader, forward-looking national energy policy after the 1973-1974 oil shocks. “This crisis,” Emanuel said, referring to the 2007-2008 financial meltdown, “provides the opportunity ... to do things that you could not do before.” For this, he was pilloried by conservatives, who called him cynical. But his critics were the cynics. Emanuel had added this point: “The good news ... if you want to see a silver lining, is the problems are big enough that they lend themselves to ideas from both parties for the solution.” Houston Chronicle Managing Editor Vernon Loeb made this point recently while appealing to the better angels of his media colleagues’ natures. Loeb said that the supposed spat between the Democratic mayor of Houston and the Republican governor of Texas was largely invented. The editor focused on global warming, which may or not be relevant to Hurricane Harvey. Perhaps the problem is Houston’s unrestrained urban sprawl. Maybe this is just a very bad storm. But his instinct to think bigger is laudable — and increasingly rare. Advertisement Which brings us to Charlottesville. What took place in that Virginia college town three weeks ago raises profound public policy questions far beyond the fate of Confederate statues. Is the pernicious idea emanating from campuses’ identity politics — namely, that politically incorrect speech is “violence” — encouraging actual violence? Conversely, does the sight of 200 white men carrying torches and firearms while chanting about Jews and blood and soil suggest a limit to First Amendment protections? Why are police around the country letting masked anarchists physically attack conservative speakers? Is a U.S. president duty-bound to speak about race relations more thoughtfully and articulately than Donald Trump has done? But whether the challenge is a historic flood or a small stream of hate-filled racists, there’s always the next fundraising letter to go out, the next election to be won. Take the Sierra Club, for example. When presidential aide Stephen Bannon left the White House, this tax-exempt group expended exactly five words dealing with the environment (“withdrawing from the Paris Agreement”) in a vitriolic personal attack on him. The rest had nothing to do with conservation. On Friday, the Sierra Club used Hurricane Harvey to attack Trump — over immigration. Such vitriol may help raise money, but it doesn’t solve problems. I suspect problem-solving wasn’t interim NAACP President Derrick Johnson’s goal when he blamed the Trump administration for creating a climate where hate groups “feel comfortable to walk in public without the hoods anymore.” This was the bookend statement, equally clueless, to the president’s assertion that “some very fine people” marched in Charlottesville in support of Robert E. Lee’s statute. Christopher Cantwell, one of the “very fine people” leading that march, told a reporter that Trump disgusts him, if for no other reason than that his daughter Ivanka is married to Jared Kushner, who’s Jewish. “I don’t think that you could feel about race the way that I do,” Cantwell said, “and watch that Kushner bastard walk around with that beautiful girl, OK?” Meanwhile, the identity politics professionals on the left were invoking purity tests of their own. It was almost as if they were in league with the racist loons in Charlottesville. Los Angeles’ City Council responded to Charlottesville by replacing Columbus Day with “Indigenous Peoples Day.” This was just the kind of slippery slope Trump warned about, and many Italian-Americans were not happy. You wonder where it all ends, or if it ever will. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called for a review of “all symbols of hate” on city property. The mayor, who is himself Italian-American, refused to rule out bringing down the iconic cast of the Genoese mariner whose statue adorns Columbus Circle, a Manhattan landmark. That day, Hizzoner was ambushed by local CBS reporter Marcia Kramer, who suggested that de Blasio take aim at Grant’s Tomb because the Union general — the general who defeated Robert E. Lee — “is regarded by some as anti-Semitic.” “In 1862, he signed General Order 11, which expelled Jews from Kentucky, Tennessee and Mississippi,” Kramer said. “I wonder if you think someone who did that, given the large number of Jews who live in New York, he should be buried here,” she asked the mayor. “I’m not familiar with that history,” de Blasio replied. There’s no reason he should be, because that’s not history, it’s a caricature. Grant did issue a hasty, ill-considered edict banning Jews from his military district. It was so out of character that his officers ignored it, and Abe Lincoln promptly rescinded it. Grant’s lapse in judgment became, briefly, a campaign issue when he ran for president in 1868. He handled it by apologizing publicly and privately. As president, Grant appointed more Jews to his administration than any of his predecessors and sent an envoy to Bucharest to support victims of anti-Jewish persecution. When he died, Grant was mourned in synagogues throughout the country. Here’s another notorious wartime edict the guardians of “marginalized people” might consider: Executive Order 9066. It was issued on Feb. 19, 1942, by Franklin D. Roosevelt. Lincoln wasn’t around to reverse it, and FDR’s order resulted in 110,000 Japanese-Americans or legal residents of Japanese descent being sent to internment camps. Are progressives willing to go after FDR in their sanitization efforts? That would break the Democratic Party in two. U.S. Grant offers another lesson — in prudence, if not political correctness. For our current president or any contemporary politician inclined to respond off-the-cuff or use social media to impart half-baked policies regarding race or religion, General Order 11 is a useful reminder. Grant spoke to this himself. “I do not sustain that order,” he rued later. “It would never have been issued if it had not been telegraphed the moment it was penned, and without reflection.” Carl M.

{"global_context": "The secretary of state said Washington had not determined who was to blame for “health attacks” on American diplomats in Havana. “This is likely another installment in the long saga of spy-vs-spy in U.S.-Cuba relations,” said Peter Kornbluh, a co-author of “Back Channel to Cuba: The Hidden History of Negotiations Between Washington and Havana.” The Cuban government has long harassed American government employees in Havana. Stories of feces left in diplomats’ residences became part of Cold War lore. The power would go out, and agents would tailgate diplomats’ vehicles and make it impossible to change lanes. But the recent sicknesses were worse than the standard harassment, even in the worst times, officials said. “They would come into your house and erase the pictures of your kids off your computer, or turn all the books around on your bookshelf, just to show you that you had no privacy,” said James Cason, who ran the United States Interests Section in Havana a decade ago said. “They never did anything physical to anybody.” This, he said, “sounds like a science experiment.” The mystery deepened this week, when Canada said that its employees had also gotten sick.

LeoGrande, a professor at American University who is the other author of “Back Channel To Cuba.” “None of the existing speculations make any sense to me.” John Caulfield, chief of mission at the United States Interests Section in Havana from 2011 to 2014, said it was “inconceivable” that a third government would have been able to act without the knowledge if not the cooperation of the Cubans. The Cuban government, he said, kept “such close tabs on us they would’ve immediately detected someone else.” He added, “My speculation is that it was a surveillance effort that went bad.” In a statement Thursday, the Cuban Foreign Ministry said that “Cuba has never allowed or will it allow the Cuban territory to be used for any action against accredited diplomatic officials or their families, without exception.” Several Americans cut their tours in Cuba short after falling ill last year, the State Department said, adding that the government expelled two Cuban diplomats from Washington, because Cuba had failed in its obligation to keep American diplomats safe. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The State Department said the employees got sick in late 2016. The Cuban government learned of it in February and two of its diplomats were expelled in May. Mark Feierstein, a former senior adviser at the National Security Council, said the fact that President Trump did not tear up the Obama administration’s Cuba policy demonstrated that even the Trump administration did not believe that Cuban senior officials were responsible. In June, Mr. Trump curtailed a few minor Cuba policy rules, but left the majority of Mr. Obama’s measures intact. Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security in the Obama administration who helped negotiate the normalization of relations with Cuba, said he also found it inconceivable that Cuba would intentionally physically harm American diplomats. “It just doesn’t strike me as something the Cuban government would do,” Mr. Rhodes said. “They’ve been pragmatic about Trump.”.

{"global_context": "Craft came under fire from Democrats for her views on climate change and her ties to the coal industry. Her husband is the CEO a major U.S. coal company. CLOSE President Donald Trump says former aide Dina Powell is under consideration to replace departing U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. Trump said he heard his daughter Ivanka Trump's name discussed for the post. (Oct. 9) AP WASHINGTON – The Senate confirmed President Donald Trump’s nominee for United Nations ambassador on Wednesday, sending Kelly Knight Craft to fill the high-profile diplomatic post that’s been vacant for seven months. Craft’s confirmation, by a 56-to-34 vote, marks a victory not just for Trump but also for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who pressed the president to tap her for the job. \"I’m confident our entire nation will be proud of the fine service she will render as our Ambassador to the United Nations,\" McConnell tweeted after the Senate vote. He trumpeted Craft's tenure as the U.S. ambassador to Canada, particularly her work in the negotiations over a new trade agreement between the U.S., Canada and Mexico. \"By all accounts, Ambassador Craft’s involvement led to greater cooperation,\" McConnell said in a statement Wednesday. But Craft came under fire from Senate Democrats for her views on climate change and her family ties to the coal industry. Craft is a top Republican donor from Kentucky, and her billionaire husband, Joseph Craft III, is the president and CEO of Alliance Resource Partners, a major U.S. coal company. Craft sparked ridicule and outrage in 2017, when she claimed to believe scientists on “both sides” of the climate change debate in an interview with Canada’s CBC television network. In this Oct. 23, 2017, file photo, United States Ambassador to Canada Kelly Knight Craft speaks after presenting her credentials during a ceremony at Rideau Hall in Ottawa. (Photo: Adrian Wyld, AP) “I believe there are scientists on both sides that are accurate,” Craft said when asked if she believed in climate change. \"I think that both sides have, you know, their own results from their studies, and I appreciate and respect both sides of the science.” Craft flipped her stance during her confirmation hearing last month, telling senators on the Foreign Relations Committee that she believes climate change presents a \"real risk\" and promising to take the issue seriously in her work at the U.N. \"Climate change needs to be addressed as it poses real risk to our planet,\" Craft said at the June hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Many Democrats remained skeptical despite her promise to take climate change seriously at the U.N. The international body has called climate change \"the defining issue of our time\" as extreme weather, rising sea levels and other problems unfold across the globe. Sen. Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, noted that Craft refused to say she would recuse herself from fossil fuel or climate change matters \"despite her spouse’s vast energy interests.\" In a report issued hours before Wednesday's vote, Menendez said that Craft allowed her husband to attend official energy and environmental meetings in her capacity as U.S. ambassador to Canada. He also raised pointed questions about her absence from that post. \"Craft spent 357 days out of Canada (more than 58% of her tenure),\" Menendez report states. \"Craft spent 210 days (7 months) in Kentucky or Oklahoma, where she and her spouse have homes.\" McConnell and other Republicans dismissed those accusations, saying she was often in Washington to attend trade talks – not vacationing with her family. \"I have no doubt Ambassador Craft will faithfully represent the United States and I look forward to working with her as she assumes her new role,” said Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

{"global_context": "Trump Jr. posted a meme over the weekend that mocked a confidential letter that Christine Blasey Ford sent over the summer to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) detailing her allegations against Kavanaugh. A day after Donald Trump Jr. appeared to mock Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh of sexual assault, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway showed support for Ford, saying that she “should not be insulted, and she should not be ignored.” Ford recently spoke out against Kavanaugh, whom she alleges sexually assaulted her when the two were teenagers, raising critical questions only days before his confirmation vote was set to take place. Some lawmakers are now calling for the vote to be delayed. Trump Jr. posted what appeared to be a meme over the weekend, showing a picture of an apparent schoolboy love note with the caption: “Judge Kavanaughs sexual assault letter found by Dems.” The satirical note shared by Trump Jr. was written in crayon, reading “Hi Cindy will you be my girlfreind.” It included two boxes, one for “yes” and one for “no,” and it was signed, “Love Bret.” It appeared to be mocking a confidential letter that Ford sent over the summer to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, detailing her allegations against Kavanaugh. “Oh boy . . . the Dems and their usual nonsense games really have him on the ropes now,” Trump Jr. wrote, claiming that Feinstein had saved the letter and released it in time for the vote. “Honorable as always,” Trump Jr. added. A representative for Trump Jr. could not immediately be reached for comment by The Washington Post. [California professor, writer of confidential Brett Kavanaugh letter, speaks out about her allegation of sexual assault] Conway said Monday on “Fox & Friends” that Ford “should be heard,” but, she added, “so should he,” saying that both Ford and Kavanaugh are expected to give their accounts in sworn testimony that will then be provided to lawmakers in time for the vote. Conway did not directly address the meme Trump Jr. tweeted. Conway also showed support for Kavanaugh, who has denied the allegations, saying that he is “a man of character and integrity” who has been vetted by the FBI and “lauded” by women who have known him throughout his life. President Trump has also defended Kavanaugh, telling reporters, “We want to go through a full process . . . and hear everybody out.” According to The Post’s Emma Brown, who wrote about Ford and her accusations against the Supreme Court nominee: Speaking publicly for the first time, Ford said that one summer in the early 1980s, Kavanaugh and a friend — both “stumbling drunk,” Ford alleges — corralled her into a bedroom during a gathering of teenagers at a house in Montgomery County. While his friend watched, she said, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it. When she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth. “I thought he might inadvertently kill me,” said Ford, now a 51-year-old research psychologist in northern California. “He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.” Ford said she was able to escape when Kavanaugh’s friend and classmate at Georgetown Preparatory School, Mark Judge, jumped on top of them, sending all three tumbling. She said she ran from the room, briefly locked herself in a bathroom and then fled the house. Ford did not wait until the eve of the vote to come forward with her allegations. Brown wrote that Ford had contacted The Post in July, “when it had become clear that Kavanaugh was on the shortlist of possible nominees,” but she did not speak on the record for weeks “as she grappled with concerns about what going public would mean for her and her family — and what she said was her duty as a citizen to tell the story.” After Trump Jr. posted the meme on Instagram, Lynne Patton, a top official with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, commented on it, using emoji showing a laughing smiley face and raised hands, according to Mediaite. She later released a statement saying that she was not trivializing sexual assault. “To the contrary,” she tweeted, “my post was in response to the hypocrisy highlighted by @DonaldJTrumpJr inasmuch that @SenFeinstein concealed Ms. Ford’s letter for 2 mos, releasing it only when the timing best suited her own. True exploitation.” Not everyone approved. Republican former congressman Joe Walsh criticized the president’s son, calling him “an uncaring, narrow-minded idiot.” No matter your take on the accusations against Brett Kavanaugh, I think we all can agree that @DonaldJTrumpJr is an uncaring, narrow-minded idiot.https://t.co/56Wnlhz3Dw — Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) September 17, 2018 Walsh also called out Democrats for waiting until the last moment to “drop this dirt.” So Dems waited until the very last minute to drop this dirt, and now they want to wait again to hear from her?

{"global_context": "LOS ANGELES — L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti said Monday that he plans to lead a coalition of mayors calling on Congress to pass the Ending Homelessness Act. The legislation, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, would direct more than $13 billion to support the work of cities on the front lines of this crisis, deliver vital services to homeless residents and bring the unsheltered indoors, according to a statement from Garcetti’s office. Other mayors supporting this effort include Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia, Chicago Mayor Lori E. Lightfoot, Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh, Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney, Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan, Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson, Austin Mayor Steve Adler, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, Anaheim Mayor Harry Sidhu, Santa Ana Mayor Miguel Pulido, Riverside Mayor Rusty Bailey, and Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell. “Cities are fighting hard every day to turn the tide on this humanitarian crisis, and Washington has to match our urgency, our commitment, and the investment we’re making to confront it,” Garcetti said. “Homelessness is a national emergency that requires federal action, and we need Congress to be part of the solution and supply resources that can bring housing, health care, and hope to Americans suffering on our streets.” Waters’ proposal would create new affordable housing to support people experiencing homelessness. Specifically, the bill provides $5 billion over five years to support 85,000 new permanent housing units. It directs $2.5 billion over five years to new Special Purpose Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers, which would give preference to people experiencing homelessness and those most at-risk of becoming homeless. And it would add $1 billion to the National Housing Trust Fund, which is expected to create 25,000 new units for extremely low-income households. In the coming months, Garcetti will lead this coalition to rally support for the legislation in Washington, D.C.; increase the number of cosponsors representing our cities; and testify in favor of the measure before the House of Representatives. Garcetti has proposed a U.S. Conference of Mayors resolution endorsing the legislation and calling for its immediate passage. In addition to the Ending Homelessness Act, Garcetti and his colleagues will push for action on two other pieces of legislation: the Fighting Homelessness Through Services and Housing Act sponsored by U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and U.S. Rep. Ted Lieu that would establish a new $750 million grant program to provide homeless services; and the Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act, sponsored by U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell and U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene, which would increase the housing credit allocation by 50 percent and boost affordable housing production by an estimated 450,000 homes over the next decade.

{"global_context": "Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Thursday rolled back an Obama-era policy that allowed legal marijuana to thrive without federal intervention. Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Thursday rolled back an Obama-era policy that allowed legal marijuana to thrive without federal intervention. The move effectively unleashes federal prosecutors to consider bringing marijuana cases, while stopping short of ordering them to do so. “U.S. attorneys need to make decisions in these cases as they do in other drugs cases,” a senior DOJ official told Fox News. The Obama administration back in 2013 announced via a memo from then-Deputy Attorney General James Cole that it would not obstruct states that legalized marijuana, on the condition the drug was regulated so as not to hinder key federal enforcement priorities. This included preventing the drug from being distributed to minors, preventing its movement to other states, and preventing it from being used as a cover for the trafficking of other drugs. The Department of Justice announced Thursday that it had rescinded that memo, as well as related guidance from 2009. \"Give the Department's well-established general principles, previous nationwide guidance specific to marijuana enforcement is unnecessary and is rescinded, effective immediately,\" Sessions said in a new memo. The move takes aim at the budding mainstream marijuana industry, even as it leaves up to U.S. attorneys to what extent to enforce federal law on marijuana. As for how the reversal will affect states where recreational pot use is legal and the marijuana industry as a whole, the situation is unclear. When asked if the DOJ would be bringing suit against states like California and Colorado, a senior DOJ official said only: “Further steps are still under consideration.” Jim Borghesani, a spokesman for the Yes on 4 Coalition that supported legalizing marijuana, told MassLive.com that he could not tell what impact Sessions' decision will have on Massachusetts -- where the drug was legalized via a 2016 referendum. \"Jeff Sessions is revoking the Cole memo, but he's not saying prosecutions are going to start,\" Borghesani said. \"I think it's going to come down to how individual U.S. attorneys move forward in the regions that they operate.\" Ahead of the announcement, Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., accused his fellow Republican of trampling \"on the will of voters in [Colorado] and other states\" and of contradicting what he told Gardner during his confirmation hearing. Gardner also threatened to withhold support for DOJ nominees until Sessions changes course. Such a change would appear unlikely. Sessions has blamed the increased use of the drug for spikes in violence in the U.S. and has been an outspoken critic of efforts to make its use more acceptable. “I reject the idea that America will be a better place if marijuana is sold in every corner store. And I am astonished to hear people suggest that we can solve our heroin crisis by legalizing marijuana – so people can trade one life-wrecking dependency for another that’s only slightly less awful,” he told law enforcement officials in March. “Our nation needs to say clearly once again that using drugs will destroy your life.” In a letter to congressional leaders in May, he asked them to ditch language that prevents the DOJ from spending money preventing states from implementing their own laws on medical marijuana. “I believe it would be unwise for Congress to restrict the discretion of the Department to fund particular prosecutions, particularly in the midst of an historic drug epidemic and potentially long-term uptick in violent crime,” Sessions wrote. “The Department must be in a position to use all laws available to combat the transnational drug organizations and dangerous drug traffickers who threaten American lives.” Advocates for marijuana legalization argue that banning the substance only serves to beef up the black market and allows criminals to control distribution. Sessions’ announcement came just days after California joined states such as Colorado in permitting pot for recreational purposes. The drug will be legal for adults 21 and older, and residents will be allowed to grow up to six plants and possess up to an ounce of marijuana. Reports of Sessions’ move sparked anger from Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., who said on Twitter that “basically anything” was more important than cracking down on pot use. Twenty-nine states have adopted medical marijuana laws, while seven other states have legalized the drug for recreational purposes. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

(David Santiago/Miami Herald via AP) Anxious Republicans privately expressed confidence in their narrow Senate majority but feared the House was slipping away. Trump, the GOP’s chief messenger, warned that significant Democratic victories would trigger devastating consequences. “If the radical Democrats take power they will take a wrecking ball to our economy and our future,” Trump declared in Cleveland, using the heated rhetoric that has defined much of his presidency. He added: “The Democrat agenda is a socialist nightmare.” Democrats, whose very relevance in the Trump era depended on winning at least one chamber of Congress, were laser-focused on health care as they predicted victories that would break up the GOP’s monopoly in Washington and state governments. “They’ve had two years to find out what it’s like to have an unhinged person in the White House,” said Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who leads the Democratic Governors Association. “It’s an awakening of the Democratic Party.” Democrats could derail Trump’s legislative agenda for the next two years should they win control of the House or the Senate. Perhaps more important, they would claim subpoena power to investigate Trump’s personal and professional shortcomings. Some Democrats have vowed to force the release of his tax returns. Others have pledged to pursue impeachment, although removal from office is unlikely so long as the GOP controls the Senate or maintains even a healthy minority. Democrats’ fate depends upon a delicate coalition of infrequent voters — particularly young people and minorities — who traditionally shun midterm elections. If ever there was an off-year election for younger voters to break tradition, this is it. Young voters promised to vote in record numbers as they waged mass protests in the wake of the February mass shooting at a Parkland, Florida, high school that left 17 students and staff dead. Democrats are drawing strength from women and college-educated voters, who swung decidedly against Trump since his election. Polling suggests the Republican coalition is increasingly older, whiter, more male and less likely to have a college degree. Democrats boast record diversity on the ballot. Three states could elect their first African-American governors, while several others are running LGBT candidates and Muslims. A record number of women are also running for Senate, House, governorships and state legislative seats. “The vast majority of women voters are angry, frustrated and they are really done with seeing where the Republican Party is taking them, particularly as it related to heath care and civility,” said Stephanie Schriock, who leads EMILY’s List, a group that help elect Democratic women. “You’re going to see the largest gender gap we’ve ever seen.” The political realignment, defined by race, gender and education, could re-shape U.S. politics for a generation. The demographic shifts also reflect each party’s closing argument. While the economy continues to thrive, Trump has spent much of the campaign’s final days railing against a caravan of Latin American immigrants hoping to seek asylum at the U.S. border. He dispatched more than 5,000 troops to the region, suggesting soldiers would use lethal force against migrants who throw rocks, before later reversing himself. Republicans have privately encouraged the president to back off, to no avail. Democrats, meanwhile, have beat their drum on health care. “Health care is on the ballot,” former President Barack Obama told Democratic volunteers in Virginia. “Health care for millions of people. You vote, you might save a life.” Tuesday’s results will be colored by the dramatically different landscapes in the fight for the House and Senate. Most top House races are set in America’s suburbs where more educated and affluent voters in both parties have soured on Trump’s presidency, despite the strength of the national economy. Democrats were buoyed by a wave of Republican retirements and an overwhelming fundraising advantage. Jay Hutchins, a 49-year-old Democrat who voted in the Washington suburb of Silver Spring, Maryland, is among those dissatisfied with Trump and the Republican-led Congress. “I’m not pleased with Trump’s leadership at all. I think he’s trying to divide this country,” said Hutchins, acting executive director of a group that advocates on labor issues. “I think he’s preying upon people’s fears. I think we need a president and leadership that appeals to the better angels of folks. I don’t think Trump has done that at all.” But in Ohio, Judy Jenkins, a 60-year-old Republican, said she was voting exclusively for GOP candidates. She said she used to vote for candidates from both major parties, but vowed never to support a Democrat because she was so upset by how new Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was treated in his confirmation process. She also backs Trump and said Republicans are moving in the right direction on health care. Republicans “have actually brought the change,” she said. “That’s why our economy is growing like it is. They may not be perfect, but who is?” Democrats need to pick up two dozen seats to claim the House majority. They face a far more difficult challenge in the Senate, where they are almost exclusively on defense in rural states where Trump remains popular. Democratic Senate incumbents are up for re-election, for example, in North Dakota, West Virginia and Montana — states Trump carried by 30 percentage points on average two years ago. Democrats need to win two seats to claim the Senate majority. Given Trump’s stunning victory in 2016, few expressed confidence in predictions. “I feel less comfortable making a prediction today than I have in two decades,” Republican pollster Frank Luntz said.

{"global_context": "Nikki Haley has said she will not run for president in 2020. But would she run for vice president in 2020 and then president in 2024?. Nikki Haley has said she will not run for president in 2020. But would she run for vice president in 2020 and then president in 2024? That could be the right path for the U.N. Ambassador, who has announced she will retire at the end of this year and who is definitely presidential material. It’s a long time until 2024. Some speculate that Haley might run for the Senate should fellow South Carolinian Lindsey Graham be appointed to replace Jeff Sessions as Attorney General after the midterm elections. Barring that opportunity, she runs the risk of fading from view and missing her moment, as Chris Christie did in 2012. Whether or not the president is reelected two years from now with Haley as his running mate, she would naturally emerge as the frontrunner in 2024. For Trump, too, putting Haley on the ticket makes all the sense in the world. Many think that in 2020, President Trump is once again likely to face off against a female candidate. Whether it is Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand or, God forbid, Hillary Clinton, his opponent (male or female) will surely attack Mr. Trump for his alleged philandering and supposed mistreatment of women. Nobody could better deflect such accusations than a woman who has worked for the president, and who can speak from personal experience of his support for capable and outspoken females. Haley is also a minority, the daughter of immigrants from India. Her mother started quite a successful retail business in the U.S. Haley’s experience working in that enterprise informs her pro-business platform, which she shares with Mr. Trump. Her background also allows her to champion intelligent immigration policies, and the benefits this nation derives from people who enter the country legally. Nikki Haley’s U.N. tenure has received high marks, even from the left-leaning media. The New York Times lamented her resignation in an editorial titled “Nikki Haley Will Be Missed,” mainly because they portray her as a bulwark against what they deem “Mr. Trump’s worst policies and instincts.” Haley has a formidable resume, more substantial than that of any of the women running on the Democratic side, barring Hillary Clinton whose credentials mainly fall into the voting “present” category, since she accomplished almost nothing during her stint as Secretary of State. Haley was the first woman and the first minority to serve as governor of South Carolina. She had previously been elected a state legislator, and served as president of the National Association of Women Business Owners. As governor, Haley was credited with being strong and compassionate as she dealt with a series of crises, including the mass shooting by Dylann Roof at the Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston. She led the citizens of her state in prayer on that occasion, and again in the aftermath of the horrific floods in 2015. The state’s second-largest newspaper said of her response to these crises, “time after time, Gov. Haley did a superior job.” They also noted that “when the nation turned its attention to South Carolina, she presented a smart, calm and confident face...” Nikki Haley has proved that she can be tough; tough with South Carolina’s legislators (to the dismay of some critics), tough with our allies and rivals in the U.N. and, on occasion, tough with President Trump. As governor for six years, she focused on attracting businesses to the state, and employment grew by 400,000 under her watch. She led reforms aimed at rooting out corruption, and she is credited with removing the Confederate Flag from the statehouse, a courageous move in South Carolina. In the middle of her second term, Haley had the 15th-highest approval ratings of any governor in the nation. Nikki Haley has proved that she can be tough; tough with South Carolina’s legislators (to the dismay of some critics), tough with our allies and rivals in the U.N. and, on occasion, tough with President Trump. And yet, she survived her tour of duty under our mercurial president; she apparently really does have diplomatic skills. By now you’re probably wondering; what about Mike Pence? Mike Pence has been a loyal number two in the Trump administration. He has rarely made waves, reliably defended the president in times of turmoil (often, in other words) and has fulfilled the critical role of bolstering the White House’s relationship with the evangelical community. During the 2016 election, the religious right eyed Mr. Trump with understandable skepticism. He had few Republican or conservative credentials, and though he professed to be pro-life was visibly bewildered about what that meant. Moreover, his various scandals and numerous wives caused heartburn amongst evangelicals. During that race, he needed Mike Pence, a Catholic altar boy in his youth and born-again Christian, to woo the evangelical community. This was an easy assignment, since Pence had long been that group’s pick among presidential candidates. As Richard Land, president of the Southern Evangelical Seminary and a Trump faith advisor told The Atlantic’s McKay Coppins, “Mike Pence is the 24-karat-gold model of what we want in an evangelical politician.” With the help of Pence, as Coppins points out, Trump won “an astonishing 81 percent of white evangelicals’ votes, more than any Republican presidential candidate on record.” The president’s standing with that community remains high; as Robert Jeffress, pastor of the First Baptist Church in Dallas tweeted on September 2, \"The primary reason Evangelicals voted for @POTUS by the widest margin of any candidate in history is because of his commitment to a conservative judiciary, and he's fulfilling that promise beyond anyone's wildest imaginations.\" The ascension of Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to the nation’s highest court, along with other measures like moving our embassy to Jerusalem, has cemented Trump’s standing with conservative Christians. But as the president fought to deflect challenges to the Kavanaugh confirmation, he further alienated the #MeToo movement and injured his standing with women. Approaching 2020, his deficit is with female voters. Knowing that more Supreme Court seats might open up, the Evangelical community is likely to stay on board. Thus, swapping out Mike Pence for Nikki Haley makes all the sense in the world for Trump. Now he just has to find another job for Mike Pence which would allow him to gracefully step down, and encourage Nikki Haley to sign on. Both those steps will require some artful deal-making, to be sure. But we’ve already seen that the president is capable of doing just that.

Ankara is battling to drive out the Kurdish YPG militia, which it sees as an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). President Emmanuel Macron met members of the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces, including the YPG. Mr Macron expressed hopes for dialogue between Turkey and the militia. His office said he had \"paid tribute to the sacrifices and the determining role\" of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in the fight against the Islamic State (IS) group.

Just a week ago, an IS sympathiser killed three people in a rampage in southern France, including a police officer who died after swapping places with a hostage. Why does France back the SDF? The SDF is a key US ally in the fight against IS and the Kurdish YPG forms a core part of it. France and the US have given the militia weapons and training to support its battle against IS. The US also backs the YPG's assertion that it has no direct organisational links to the PKK, which Turkey calls a terror group.

Democratic National Chairman Tom Perez speaks with USA TODAY Washington bureau chief Susan Page about whether Democrats are ready to make deals with President Trump. (Photo: Jasper Colt, USA TODAY) WASHINGTON – Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez called “appalling” the muted response among GOP lawmakers to revelations that President Trump’s former campaign aide sought to obtain damaging information about Hillary Clinton from people he believed had connections with the Russian government. “That is serious stuff as it relates to collusion,” Perez told reporters at a breakfast in Washington hosted by The Christian Science Monitor. Ex-Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to a charge that he lied to FBI agents about his contacts with a professor he believed was linked to the Kremlin during the campaign – one of the first prosecutions in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election.

U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that the DNC's emails were hacked at the behest of the Russian government. “We now have pretty clear evidence there was an undeniable attack on our democracy,” Perez said Tuesday. “The Russians were trying to traffic in the (Clinton campaign) emails” to get Trump elected, he said. “The rot went all the way to the top of the campaign.\" Also on Monday, a grand jury indicted former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates on charges that they secretly worked on behalf of pro-Russian factions in Ukraine, then laundered millions of dollars in profits through foreign bank accounts. Both pleaded not guilty. In the hours after the indictments and guilty plea were unsealed, Republicans began to slowly respond. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said he didn’t want to speculate on something he hadn’t read – and then said he had “nothing to add, other than nothing’s going to derail what we’re doing in Congress.” House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said he believed the election results had nothing to do with Russian interference. \"I think Russia meddles in everyone's election,\" he told CNBC. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., also sidestepped questions. \"Special Counsel has his job to do, and we’re going to concentrate on what we’re doing here,\" he told reporters. Even so, some rank-and-file Republicans, like Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois did respond clearly to the latest revelations. \"The American people deserve answers, transparency & the truth. Important to allow Mueller to do his job,\" he said in a tweet. As I’ve said from day one, the American people deserve answers, transparency & the truth. Important to allow Mueller to do his job. — Adam Kinzinger (@RepKinzinger) October 30, 2017 Still, Perez said it's \"troubling to me to see such appalling silence from so many Republican leaders. The silence isn’t just deafening, it’s appalling.” In this, Perez said, Republicans are repeating the history of the Watergate scandal that ultimately brought down Richard Nixon’s presidency – when it “took way too long for all to many Republicans to realize they need to put country over party.\" Trump hasn't been quiet on the indictment news – but he has been dismissive of it. In an early morning tweet, Trump called Papadopoulos a \"liar\" and \"low level volunteer\" on the campaign, seeking to downplay any suggestion of collusion between his campaign and Russia. “There have been some courageous Republicans” who have been speaking out, Perez noted. “I hope there are more who do so.” Perez also responded to news reports that Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the DNC helped fund a dossier produced by a former British spy that makes controversial claims about Trump’s ties to the Kremlin, including salacious anecdotes about his activities in Moscow. The firm that performed the research, Fusion GPS, was paid by a law firm working for Democrats. “Opposition research is not simply something that ought to be done. It would be malpractice not to do it, especially when you have a presidential candidate who blew convention out a window,” said Perez.

Mr. Sharif was arrested after landing at Lahore airport by officers from the National Accountability Bureau, the country’s anticorruption authority, said Shaukat Javed, the provincial interior minister. Mr. Javed said the former prime minister was put on a specially arranged flight to Islamabad. Mr. Sharif is expected to be held at Adiala jail, just outside the capital Islamabad, which has a high-security wing. The former prime minister was in London, visiting his sick wife, when a Pakistan court last week concluded a corruption case against him and ordered a 10-year sentence. His daughter and political heir, Maryam Nawaz Sharif, who returned with him Friday and was also arrested, was sentenced to seven years in the same case. Ahead of Mr. Sharif’s return, police swept through Lahore, arresting scores of Mr. Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League party workers to prevent them from greeting him at the airport. An injured Pakistani man is brought to a hospital in Quetta on Friday following a bomb blast at an election rally.

Underscoring the security threat, more than 70 people, including a political candidate, were killed in a deadly attack on an election rally in southwestern Balochistan province on Friday. A suicide bomber blew himself up amid scores of supporters who had gathered at a rally in Mastung, a town in Balochistan. The candidate who died, Siraj Raisani, is the brother of the former Balochistan chief minister, Aslam Raisani. Caretaker Home Minister Agha Umar Bungalzai told the Associated Press that another 120 people were wounded in the bombing. An earlier bomb Friday killed four people in the northwest near the election rally of a senior politician from an Islamist party who is running for parliament from the northwestern town of Bannu. The explosion targeted candidate Akram Khan Durrani, who escaped unhurt, and wounded 20 people, said local police chief Rashid Khan. Supporters of the Pakistan Muslim League marched toward the airport to welcome home former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Photo: mohsin raza/Reuters Mr. Durrani is running in the July 25 vote against popular former lawmaker Imran Khan. He is a candidate of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, an election alliance of radical religious groups. The second explosion was the one that killed dozens and critically wounded the candidate Mr. Raisani. No one claimed responsibility for either bombing, but the attacks came days after a suicide bomber dispatched by the Pakistani Taliban killed secular politician Haroon Ahmed Bilour and 20 others at his rally in the northwestern city of Peshawar. Former lawmaker Imran Khan, who hopes to become the next prime minister, condemned Friday’s attack against his opponent. In a tweet, he said there seems to be a conspiracy to sabotage the July 25 vote.

{"global_context": "Even by the standards of this polarized political era, candidates Lena Gonzalez and Jack Guerrero present a stark contrast to voters in a special election runoff Tuesday, June 4, for a new state senator representing southeast Los Angeles County. Their differences on issues are so deep and numerous that when Gonzalez, a Democrat from Long Beach, heard Guerrero, a Republican from Cudahy, say something she liked during their lone debate in early May, she couldn’t help remarking: “This is one thing I agree on.” The subject was a secondary provision of a proposed state tax on oil and gas extraction. The audience responded to the fleeting moment of harmony with its mildest applause of the night. Otherwise, even a quick glance at the rivals’ positions should leave no confusion about who’s who. “It’s a clear contrast,” said Peter Sovich, chairman of Long Beach Area Republicans, who supports Guerrero, 45, a Cudahy city councilman, in the 33rd Senate District contest. “I think it is a very distinct choice,” said Chris Chavez, president of Long Beach Young Democrats, who backs Gonzalez, 38, a Long Beach city councilwoman. Interviews, debates and the candidates’ campaign websites show what the candidates care about most. For Gonzalez, who’s seeking state office for the first time, the emphasis is on progressive measures to protect the environment, support public education, promote affordable housing and protections for tenants, and create a single-payer health-care system serving legal and illegal residents. She supports California’s controversial gas tax to fund highway repairs, sees the state “in a good place” on controlling employee pension costs, and considers the illegal-immigrant “sanctuary” policies of the state and many cities to be a “settled issue.” For Guerrero, a government reformer in Cudahy who has lost races for state Assembly and treasurer, priorities include reducing taxes and regulations to improve California’s business climate, cutting public employees’ pensions to ward off a fiscal crisis, and reforming the education system by expanding school vouchers and de-emphasizing teachers’ tenure protections. He’s against the gas tax, against single-payer health insurance, wary of the side effects of many state environmental and housing programs, and wants to discourage illegal immigration. Although social issues generally don’t come up in his campaign unless he’s asked, Guerrero is anti-abortion and anti-gay-marriage. (When that last part drew jeers from the crowd at a debate with primary opponents in February, Guerrero went on to say he’s against government playing a role in sanctioning any marriages). Guerrero’s manner is courtly and welcoming. A Stanford- and Harvard-educated economist and CPA, he argues that conservative policies would benefit poor communities in the small cities along the 710 Freeway. But unlike many Republicans running for office in mostly Democratic Southern California, Guerrero doesn’t try to make his policies sound moderate to appeal to non-GOP voters. That might seem like unwise strategy in a district where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 4 to 1. “It’s one of those things that may hurt him in this particular election,” said Justin Levitt, adjunct professor of political science at Long Beach State. “But if he’s got his eye on (higher) office, it could help him when he runs for a state office or seeks to be involved in Republican partisan politics.” Guerrero supporters say his unabashed conservatism is helping him in this campaign. “I think people respect that,” Sovich said. “He could play the middle of the road. But he comes out and says what he thinks is best for the state. “He’s always tying it to lower- or middle-class voters. Democrats aren’t used to hearing that (from a Republican). I think that’s why he’s got support here. “The gas tax is a perfect example. Lena is for that; every Democrat is for that. (But) it hurts the little guy” who drives a lot for work. But Kristina Bigdeli, Gonzalez’s campaign manager, said Guerrero’s message for lower-income voters masks values that don’t line up with most Californians’. “Maybe Jack Guerrero talks the talk, but Lena actually cares about California communities,” Bigdeli said. Gonzalez said at the May 6 debate in Long Beach she believes in “California values that are progressive and inclusive.” But David Hernandez, an adviser to Guerrero, said his Democratic opponent is overlooking more tangible issues, including threats to the state’s fiscal health. “They (Democrats) cannot talk about what they’ll do on those issues because they’ve had their opportunity and they didn’t get anything done,” Hernandez said. “So they talk about issues that will get people riled up.” The winner Tuesday will fill the 33rd Senate District seat left vacant when Democrat Ricardo Lara of Bell Gardens was elected California insurance commissioner last November. The next regular election is in 2020 for the seat representing most of Long Beach and cities to the north, including South Gate, Lakewood, Lynwood, Huntington Park, Paramount, Bell Gardens, Bell, Maywood, Cudahy, Signal Hill, Vernon and a small part of Los Angeles. Gonzalez and Guerrero advanced by finishing first and second — with 31.6% and 14%, respectively — among nine Democrats, two Republicans and one Green Party member in the March 26 primary. Only 8.1% of registered voters cast ballots. Voter turnout could be a few percentage points higher for the runoff, for which mail-in ballots went out May 6. Turnout might be helped by the fact one-third of ballots in the Senate district include Measure EE, the L.A. Unified School District parcel-tax referendum. Both campaigns planned to spend the weekend knocking on doors and holding rallies with supporters to try to increase voting for their candidate. “A lot of people (say), ‘Oh, OK — there’s an election?’ ” Hernandez said. Those who haven’t paid attention yet won’t have to study Gonzalez and Guerrero for too long to spot the differences.

{"global_context": "Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis' resignation officially ends the \"adults in the room\" era of Trump's presidency. Get the Think newsletter. By Jeff McCausland, retired U.S. Army colonel and former member of the National Security Council Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis’ resignation — apparently on principle — has rocked the U.S. national security community, if not the entire nation. Retired military officers, former cabinet officials, think tank experts and congressional leaders from both parties appear united in their concern about the implications for the nation’s future security. Mattis, along with fellow generals John Kelly (Trump’s exiting chief-of-staff) and H.R. McMaster (Trump’s former national security advisor) had been mostly viewed as a source of stabilizing counsel for a president with little to no experience in government or national security affairs. They were the proverbial “adults in the room” — even as their influence appeared to wane. And now they are all gone. With Mattis’ departure, it is an open question who will advise Trump on issues of national security as the president increasingly acts on impulse rather than expert counsel. With Mattis’ departure, it is an open question who will advise Trump on issues of national security as the president increasingly acts on impulse rather than expert counsel. This governing strategy is generally concerning, but it is particularly worrisome in the context of military deployments and global alliances. The position of U.S. president requires more than the ability to rile up your domestic base — you must also take your responsibilities as commander-in-chief seriously. An impetuous or poorly thought out domestic order is bad enough — one that impacts our international security apparatus could start a war. It had been rumored for some time that Mattis would soon depart the administration. He and Trump disagreed on many major policy issues, as suggested by his uncharacteristically candid resignation letter. Furthermore, it seemed clear that the secretary was frequently not consulted and was even surprised when the president announced significant changes in American security policy. Mattis had testified before Congress that the U.S. should remain in the JCPOA, also known as the Iran nuclear deal, that the president opposed. After Trump stunned South Korea with an agreement to unilaterally end all joint exercises between U.S. and South Korean forces, Mattis reinstated the war games. Mattis also noted at several points in his resignation letter the critical importance of our allies. But he was forced to devote significant time in the aftermath of the NATO summit to repairing relations with our European counterparts following public disparaging remarks by the president. In many ways, Mattis’ resignation letter was not only a formal protest but also a detailed critique of the president’s policies and worldview. The apparent final straw was the president’s recent tweet announcing a precipitous American withdrawal from Syria. Mattis, General Joe Dunford (chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff), and other senior administration officials have been clear in the past few weeks: An enduring defeat of ISIS has not been achieved. The Pentagon has estimated that thousands of ISIS fighters remained despite the loss of the territory that had comprised the so-called Caliphate. Indeed, the air campaign continues in the region, with over 100 air strikes in the last week. Furthermore, U.S. stated objectives in Syria have long included the departure of Iranian forces and proxies as well as the establishment of a political process that would eventually end a civil war that has human rights organizations say has resulted in 500,000 Syrian dead and millions of refugees. Sadly, none of these goals have been achieved. Rather, it now appears the United States will leave a vacuum in Syria that will be filled by Russia, Turkey, and Iran to the detriment of our Kurdish allies, Israel and the Syrian people. But more broadly, what does the Mattis resignation tell us, our allies and our potential adversaries about American national security strategy at the onset of 2019? Recent presidents have often adopted policies that differed from their predecessors and not always agreed with their closest advisers. Still, each adhered to a process that insured relevant advisers and cabinet members were involved, options were vetted and secondary consequences considered. Allied governments were consulted, particularly when they were providing significant military forces to a combined effort. This all occurred within the context of a national security strategy to insure policy choices were aligned with longer-term objectives. That no longer appears to be the case in the current administration. Major decisions are made on Twitter at the apparent whim of the president. But more broadly, what does the Mattis resignation tell us, our allies and our potential adversaries about American national security strategy at the onset of 2019? Trump has already announced that the search for a new secretary of defense has begun. Obvious requirements include a broad experience in national security affairs, a deep understanding of geopolitics, a grasp of the workings of the Pentagon and background in the policy process. But a secretary of defense, like any cabinet officer, can only be successful if he or she believes their counsel is valued and welcome by the chief executive. Ultimately, the next secretary of defense’s primary responsibility must be to speak truth to power. For the security of the nation, he or she must tell Trump what he needs to know even when the president disagrees or does not want to hear it. If the president surrounds himself solely with those who patronize and only tell him what he wants to hear the American people are poorly served and the nation’s future security is put at risk.

{"global_context": "Longtime GOP operative has pleaded not guilty to lying, obstruction and witness tampering. Roger Stone enters federal court in Washington, where he pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to charges in the special counsel’s Russia probe. (Calla Kessler/The Washington Post) President Trump’s longtime friend Roger Stone is set to return to federal court Friday for a scheduling hearing after pleading not guilty this week to charges in special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. Stone, 66, a longtime GOP operative and self-described “dirty trickster,” is charged with lying about his efforts to gather information concerning hacked Democratic Party emails. A seven-count indictment unsealed Jan. 25 alleges Stone sought that information before the election at the direction of an unidentified senior Trump campaign official. Ahead of Friday’s hearing before U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the District, prosecutors and Stone’s defense lawyers agreed in court filings on a proposed protective order to keep evidence turned over by the government secret, and to waive Stone’s normal speedy trial rights, citing the complexity of the case. The government said it will provide the defense with hard drives containing “terabytes” of data, including search warrants for Apple iCloud accounts and email accounts, bank and financial records, and contents of Stone’s devices such as cellphones, computers and storage drives spanning “several years.” The government said it also plans to turn over the contents of devices seized last week from Stone’s home, apartment and office. Stone is free on a $250,000 personal recognizance bond on the condition that he not possess or apply for a passport and not travel outside southern Florida, the Washington D.C. area and New York City. [Longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone charged with lying in Russia investigation] Prosecutors charge that in 2016, Stone repeatedly sought to learn when potentially damaging internal emails from Hillary Clinton’s campaign would be released. By itself, those actions may not constitute a crime, but Stone is accused of lying to Congress when asked about the efforts. He also is charged with obstruction and witness tampering. U.S. authorities in July indicted a dozen Russian military intelligence officers on charges they hacked Democrats’ computers, stole data and shared those files to disrupt the 2016 election. In Stone’s indictment, prosecutors charged that after the initial July 22, 2016, release of stolen emails, “a senior Trump campaign official was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases and what other damaging information Organization 1” had regarding the Clinton campaign. The indictment does not name the campaign official or who directed the alleged outreach to Stone. People familiar with the case identified “Organization 1” as WikiLeaks, the global anti-secrecy group founded by Julian Assange. [Trump advisers lied over and over again, Mueller says. The question is, why?] Stone has repeatedly denied any contact with Russia or WikiLeaks. He has said that he had no advance knowledge of what material WikiLeaks held and that predictions he made about the group’s plans were based on Assange’s public comments and tips from associates. Stone and WikiLeaks and Assange have said they never communicated with each other. Stone, a veteran GOP operative and friend of Trump’s for four decades, briefly advised the presidential campaign in 2015 and remained in contact with Trump and top advisers through the election.

{"global_context": "EVANSVILLE, Ind. — Casting the midterms as a referendum on his agenda, President Donald Trump urged Indiana voters to unseat Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly, saying the vulnerable Democrat is \"not going to vote for us on anything.\" Trump, who is kicking up his campaign travel as the midterm elections near, appeared in Evansville on Thursday night to boost support for wealthy Republican businessman Mike Braun, who is facing off against Donnelly in what is viewed as one of the nation's most competitive Senate races. Before a wildly enthusiastic crowd, Trump called Braun a \"special guy\" and said he will \"be a truly great senator.\" Braun took the stage and pledged to be a \"true ally\" to Trump, \"not somebody that says something when you're in Indiana and does something differently when you're in D.C.\" In a state the president carried by roughly 19 percentage points in 2016, both candidates have sought to stress their connections to Trump. Braun has welcomed Trump's backing, greeting him at the airport as he arrived in Indiana on Thursday. Before the rally, Trump attended a private roundtable and fundraising reception. Trump ticked through a number of Donnelly votes, saying he opposed his tax bill and voted against repealing President Barack Obama's health care law. Donnelly's campaign pushed back on Trump's critique, citing a study from Congressional Quarterly that shows he voted with Trump 62 percent of the time in 2017 and noting that the candidate had 22 proposals signed into law by Trump. After the rally, Donnelly said in a statement: \"We're always happy to have President Trump in Indiana, but Hoosiers still want a senator who always puts them first before any politician or political party.\" The president returned to the campaign trail after a bruising stretch, including widespread condemnation for his muted response to the death of Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the revelation that key outside associates had been granted immunity as part of one of the investigations circling the White House and a plea deal from his former personal attorney and the conviction of his onetime campaign chairman. Trump did not mention McCain amid a five-day stretch of national mourning for the longtime Arizona lawmaker and decorated war veteran with whom the president had long feuded. Trump drew harsh criticism for staying quiet for two days before issuing a terse statement honoring McCain's death. Trump's speech largely focused on his favored talking points. He pushed his agenda, arguing that Democrats in power would halt his efforts to cut taxes and roll back regulation and would block his long-promised border wall. To deafening applause he argued that \"Republicans want strong borders\" and said \"Democrats want to abolish ICE,\" the government agency tasked with enforcing the nation's immigration laws. Trump also promoted his record, again calling the economy the best in the \"history of our country\" and boasting about \"putting tariffs on foreign producers who cheat our workers and cheat our companies.\" The economy and jobs are nowhere close to historic bests based on several measures. And Trump's decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports would help many domestic steel and aluminum mills while likely increasing prices for the factories that rely on those metals. Trump again threatened to intervene in the Justice Department if it fails to take the actions he's demanding, saying the leaders of the DOJ and FBI \"have to start doing their job and doing it right\" because \"people are angry.\" If they don't do their job, he said, he \"will get involved and I'll get in there if I have to.\" Trump has a long-standing feud with Attorney General Jeff Sessions and has called on him to investigate former rival Hillary Clinton and others. Some of the issues he's raised have either already been examined or are in the process of being investigated. Trump repeated an attack on social media companies, saying, \"We as a country cannot tolerate political censorship, blacklisting and rigged search results. We will not let large organizations silence conservative voices.\" This week, Trump accused Google and other U.S. tech companies of rigging search results about him. Google pushed back sharply, saying Trump's claim simply wasn't so. Early in the rally, a volunteer member of Trump's advance team blocked a photojournalist's lens as he tried to take a photo of a protester inside the arena. Trump paced on stage during the moments it took for the protester to be led out. Heading into the final months of campaigning, the Republican Party is defending its majorities in the House and Senate, facing retirements and an energized Democratic opposition. Democrats are increasingly bullish about their chances to capture the 23 seats they need to retake the House. But flipping the Senate remains a much tougher prospect, given that 10 incumbents are running in states Trump won. Trump is aiming to spend more than 40 days on the campaign trail between the beginning of August and the Nov. 6 midterms. The officials said Trump wants to be on the road for Republicans more than Obama was for Democrats in 2010 — when his party suffered what Obama called a \"shellacking\" — and beyond what President George W.

Trump picked wrong guy to fight with in James We have come to this: A president with a fourth-grade vocabulary and an aversion to truth, devoid of compassion and impulse control, is attacking the intelligence of a basketball star who just donated $50 million to build a school for at-risk students. That the most powerful man on the planet is also among the most peevish is, by now, a given. That Donald Trump would rather do battle with black athletes than malevolent dictators is, at a minimum, reflective of his skewed sensibilities and his willingness to pander to the racist element in his base. “Lebron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon,” Trump tweeted Friday night. “He made Lebron look smart, which isn’t easy to do. I like Mike!” First of all, it’s LeBron, not “Lebron.” Second, didn’t Trump call Bill Maher “the dumbest man on television” on Jan. 14, 2013? Are we to believe Maher got smarter in the interim or Lemon dumber? Third, shouldn’t the president of the United States have higher priorities than immediate payback for perceived slights? “A sign of an insecure human being is one who attacks others to make themselves feel better,” read a tweet from former Louisville star Donovan Mitchell's account on Saturday. “(I’m) just sad that young kids have to see stupid tweets like these and grow up thinking it’s okay ... forget everything else Donald your (sic) setting a bad example for kids.” Moreover, in responding to recurring jabs from James with a gratuitous, unsubstantiated shot at his brainpower, Trump has picked an unusually unpromising fight. James has spent his entire adult life as a celebrity and without the slightest scent of scandal or impropriety. He has stayed married to his high school sweetheart while Trump is on his third marriage and boasted about grabbing women by the genitals. Like Trump, James has earned a billion dollars, but without six corporate bankruptcies. In donating $50 million for the Akron “I Promise” school that opened Monday, James is providing an on-site food bank for students and job placement assistance for their parents. Each student is issued a bicycle and every graduate, beginning in 2021, is guaranteed free tuition at the University of Akron.

His racist remarks at a rally in Ohio have proved that he is getting more emboldened and is frightened for the days when this house of cards will fall around him and possibly his family. His chosen punching bags, most recently, are celebrated sports icon LeBron James and TV news commentator Don Lemon. Both are African-Americans. To rally his base, Trump says negative things about their intelligence, as so many racists believe misguided rhetoric about men and women of color. Trump stokes coals by spurting out demeaning non-truths. He feels those words make him look strong. I believe Trump has proved that he, through his very own actions and words, is not a leader but a classic, insecure bully to the highest degree. Linda Gefen; Boca Raton, Fla. LeBron James really has chutzpah saying that the president is dividing the country by criticizing NFL players. No one in any profession has the right to protest at his workplace. It’s that simple. Not only that, the form of protest these NFL players are using is disrespecting the American flag. Plus, they do this using a platform that has tens of thousands of attendees and is shown to millions of Americans on television. And James thinks the president is dividing the country? That really takes guts. Tom Fryman; Delaware, Ohio Facebook comments edited for clarity: There is ongoing hate toward President Donald Trump. Melania Trump has done what any first lady should do in her job, create peace by reaching out. —Michael Younger I'm giving Melania Trump credit for this one. Her statement is a slap back at her husband, and sends a message to her son that here's a man who uses his fortune to do good. —Clint Murray If you ever say anything unflattering about Trump, rest assured he will throw you under the bus in a second. He lives for these moments. Goodness knows he isn't doing much of anything else. Expect it to come up at his next \"it's all about me\" pep rally that LeBron James is only a mediocre basketball player with no class. Hmmmm ... maybe they should check the origin of James' birth just in case a conspiracy needs to get generated for deportation. —Warren Weick A lot of people used to be LeBron fans, myself included. But how overbearing he has become. Good thing he is huge and gets all the calls his way in the league. —William E Mansfield What others are saying Karen Tumulty, The Washington Post: \"One of the most intriguing things about Melania Trump is the pointed yet cryptic way she seems to have found to drag her husband. ... Our oracular first lady was at it again on Saturday, seeming to issue a deft smackdown to a childish tweet President Trump had fired off late the night before. ... Melania Trump ... added the coup de grace, with a statement issued by her spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham: 'It looks like LeBron James is working to do good things on behalf of our next generation and just as she always has, the First Lady encourages everyone to have an open dialogue about issues facing children today. As you know, Mrs. Trump has traveled the country and world talking to children about their well-being, healthy living, and the importance of responsible online behavior with her Be Best initiative. Her platform centers around visiting organizations, hospitals and schools, and she would be open to visiting the I Promise School in Akron.' ... What’s significant is not just what a first lady says but when she decides to speak up. There is no requirement that she say anything at all, and this particular presidential spouse has been the most reticent going at least as far back as Pat Nixon.\" Jeff Zillgitt, USA TODAY: \"Since the 2016 election, Trump has had several opportunities to fire back at LeBron James for something James said about him. But until Friday evening, Trump resisted. Even when James called Trump a 'bum' and even when James said Trump doesn’t understand or care about the people, Trump said nothing. All the while, Trump bashed the NFL, some of its players and the Golden State Warriors, calling Steph Curry out by name. Trump left James alone — until Friday evening when he insulted the intelligence of James and CNN’s Don Lemon in a tweet. ... Why now? Joe Vardon, who covered James for Cleveland.com and covered Ohio politics before switching to sports, posits that Trump waited until James was no longer a full-time resident of Ohio, a swing state Trump needs to win in 2020. Now that James is moving to California — a state Trump won’t win — Trump felt it was OK to bash James in a tweet at 11:37 p.m. ET on a Friday. How that impacts the 2020 election, the people of Ohio will settle that. It seems like superficial play, if that’s why Trump attacked James with a third-grade insult that's hardly clever or mature.\" Dean Obeidallah, CNN: \"There's no disputing that Trump's pattern of attacking well-known African-Americans as having 'low IQs' or being of low intelligence is parroting the white nationalist view that blacks are inherently less intelligent than whites. The only question is whether Trump was intentionally espousing the views of white supremacists. Well, given Trump's history, there's only one reasonable conclusion: Trump knows exactly what he's saying.\" To join the conversations about topics on USA TODAY, email letters@usatoday.com, comment on Facebook, or use #tellusatoday on Twitter.

{"global_context": "Taylor Sappington is exactly the kind of candidate his party should want in Ohio. But he couldn’t get union support. Then came 2016, which gave Mr. Trump an eight-percentage-point win in Ohio and swept in a new state representative for the district that included Nelsonville, which had been held by a Democrat for the previous eight years. It was now held by a young Republican, Jay Edwards, who had been three years ahead of Mr. Sappington at Nelsonville-York High. He was a star quarterback who’d gone on to play linebacker at Ohio University, the scion of a prosperous local family. Mr. Sappington was still mourning the election when, just a few weeks later, he confronted darkness of a different order. His longtime boyfriend — a gentle autodidact who had taught himself to build furniture and musical instruments when not working at Ruby Tuesday — committed suicide, at age 25. At the next council meeting, Mr. Sappington spoke about the death, and the need for better mental health services in southeast Ohio. Jay Edwards was in the audience, as both Mr. Sappington and another council member recall, and stood up to leave in the middle of his remarks. (Mr. Edwards declined to comment on the record about that meeting or the race.) A few months later, Mr. Sappington suffered another loss: the suicide of one of his cousins. A high school friend, a former service member , was succumbing to opiate addiction. The gloom seemed relentless. Mr. Sappington decided the best way to fight it was to have something else to think about. Late last year, he made up his mind to run against Mr. Edwards, to reclaim the 94th House District in the Ohio statehouse for the Democrats. He knew it would be a challenge. He was young. He would be vastly outspent. On the other hand, the district had been blue until very recently, and 2018 was promising to be a strong Democratic year. And he could, at least, count on support from unions and national progressive groups.

{"global_context": "ISIS's Abu Baker al-Maqdisi insists the terrorist group was responsible for the Vegas massacre, contrary to U.S. law enforcement's rejection of that claim. Abu Baker al-Maqdisi, a senior jihadist associated with the Islamic State (ISIS) in the Gaza Strip, insists his terrorist organization was responsible for the Las Vegas massacre, contrary to U.S. law enforcement’s rejection of that claim. Al-Maqdisi fought within ISIS ranks in Syria and Iraq before returning to his native Gaza Strip. advertisement In an interview with Breitbart Jerusalem, al-Maqdisi repeated the organization’s unsubstantiated claims that Stephen Paddock, the perpetrator of the largest mass shooting attack in U.S. history, was recruited by ISIS when he converted to Islam several months ago. There is no evidence of any such conversion. “Even the weapons he used in this assault were purchased with Islamic State funds,” al-Maqdisi claimed, without offering any proof and despite Paddock’s reportedly being financially fluid enough to have purchased the weapons himself. U.S. officials say Paddock, a consummate gambler, bought 33 weapons in the last year. He also wired $100,000 to the Philippines in the days before the shooting, according to a U.S. official speaking to the Associated Press. Paddock’s girlfriend, Marilou Danley, was reportedly in the Philippines at the time of the shooting. The ISIS claim was first made by Amaq, which serves as the de facto media propaganda arm of IS. Amaq published a series of ISIS statements claiming without any evidence that Paddock was a “soldier of the caliphate” who converted to Islam several months ago and perpetrated the mass shooting “in response to calls to target states of the coalition” battling ISIS. In another statement, the Islamic State referred to Paddock by the nom de guerre of “Abu Abd al-Bar al-Ameriki.” The ISIS claims of responsibility have been rejected by the FBI, which said the shooter had no known ISIS connection. Speaking to Breitbart Jerusalem, Al-Maqdisi claimed that “in spite of Crusader misinformation about IS withdrawing in Iraq and Syria, we are still capable of making” these kinds of attacks. “There are many more lone wolves inside the U.S who are preparing more attacks. This won’t be the last one.” Al-Maqdisi claimed, “Never, since the organization got started, has it falsely claimed responsibility for something it didn’t do.” “What sets the Islamic State organization apart from all the other organizations in the Middle East is the fact that we don’t attribute to ourselves things that we are not responsible for,” added al-Maqdisi. “In addition, we have always proved, including in other events in the U.S., that our claims of responsibility are accurate.” Maqdisi’s boasts are not entirely true. Amaq does have a fairly good track record when it comes to claims of responsibility. However, as CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank pointed out in a series of tweets, ISIS took credit for two attacks since June for which it was reportedly not responsible. One ISIS false claim was a deadly casino attack in Manila in June, which turned out to be a robbery attempt, according to local authorities. Another was the claim that it smuggled weapons into Charles De Gaulle Airport last month, prompting a security alert. It turned out the alert was actually caused by a disgruntled passenger. ISIS’s false claims come as the terrorist organization has been losing major ground in Iraq and Syria. Meanwhile, Maqdisi claimed, “The attack in Marseille and the attack in Las Vegas are natural responses to the crimes of these countries against Islam and against the Muslims in Iraq and Syria.” These attacks will only increase in the coming months,” he said. He was referring to an attack in Marseille in the south of France in which two women were stabbed to death by a man reportedly yelling, “Allahu akbar,” or “Allah is great” in Arabic, according to witnesses. ISIS claimed responsibility for the carnage via the Amaq News Agency. “We announced in the past that the Islamic State has cells in America and the entire region of the West, and spectacles like those in Marseille and Las Vegas will continue to be part of the lives of the citizens of the crusader countries.” Paddock does not fit the typical profile of ISIS jihadis. Typically, it’s young men who profess their allegiance to ISIS, and many have criminal backgrounds. His name was also not listed on databases of suspected terrorists, U.S. authorities said. As Graeme Wood of the Atlantic noted, we have seen “no cell-phone video from the killer, pledging allegiance in broken Arabic. … Another absent sign of Islamic State involvement is videos from Paddock’s rifle-scope.” He added, “At attacks like the Holey Bakery in Dhaka, Bangladesh, the killers have uploaded real-time images, exclusive and corroborating imagery for Amaq.” Paddock reportedly set up a video camera inside his hotel room and had another camera in the hallway for surveillance.

Gary Caruthers, a pastor who lives in Northern Virginia, said while the differences between the Bush and Trump were fairly clear, it didn't do the nation any good to talk about the negatives during this time of national grief. \"I wish they wouldn't,\" said Caruthers, 70, of the comparisons between Trump and Bush. \"I think it only accentuates the differences that exist already, the caustic environment that exists in politics.\" Caruthers called Bush a \"bridge-builder,\" and said that seems to be a rare breed in Washington today. \"The cordiality is pretty well gone. America is pretty divided, and it's too bad that he was just a one-term president because I think he was a good man,\" Caruthers said. Caruthers said he once met Trump at the Presidents Cup golf tournament, which Trump attended last year in New Jersey. \"He was very nice, very friendly, very cordial. Didn't brush me off,\" Caruthers said of Trump. Caroline Aras, 60, said she didn't want to make comparisons between Bush and Trump, instead preferring to focus on the good the former president represented, as well as the programs he championed.

With 88 percent of precincts reporting, 28-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- who has never held elected office -- led Crowley by more than 3,600 votes. Ocasio-Cortez, a Bernie Sanders supporter who has called for the abolition of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), had gained the endorsement of several left-wing groups, including MoveOn and the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). \"We have built power. We have organized,\" Ocasio-Cortez said on Twitter as the polls closed. \"What we have built is permanent. No. Matter. What.\" Soon after The Associated Press called the race, the New York City branch of the DSA tweeted congratulations to Ocasio-Cortez, saying that her victory proved \"that working class people are hungry for a voice in politics.\" In a statement, Crowley congratulated Ocasio-Cortez on her victory and said he looked forward to supporting her against Republican Anthony Pappas in November. \"The Trump administration is a threat to everything we stand for here in Queens and the Bronx, and if we don't win back the House this November, we will lose the nation we love,\" Crowley said. \"This is why we must come together.

{"global_context": "A new report found that, among other issues, physicians weren't properly trained to certify deaths in disasters. The governor of Puerto Rico on Tuesday raised the government’s official death toll for Hurricane Maria from 64 to 2,975 people following the release of a new report. The announcement comes just weeks after officials in Puerto Rico conceded that the hurricane killed more than 1,400 people on the island last year ― over 20 times the official death toll. An independent analysis commissioned by Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Roselló and published Tuesday by researchers at George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health estimated the hurricane killed 2,975 people. That would make it the deadliest U.S. natural disaster in over 100 years. The new analysis offered a more modest estimate than a Harvard study published in May, which reported roughly 4,645 people died in the aftermath of Maria. But both studies confirm what many experts have suspected ― that the hurricane’s death toll was likely in the thousands, far greater than the 64 deaths initially acknowledged by the government. The study analyzed hurricane-caused deaths from September 2017 through the end of February 2018. Researchers identified several factors that may have caused confusion about the death toll, including a lack of communication, guidelines and training for physicians to certify deaths resulting from disasters. That led to an undercounting of deaths, the researchers suggested. “The official government estimate of 64 deaths from the hurricane is low primarily because the conventions used for causal attribution only allowed for classification of deaths attributable directly to the storm, e.g., those caused by structural collapse, flying debris, floods and drownings,” the report stated. “During our broader study, we found that many physicians were not oriented in the appropriate certification protocol. This translated into an inadequate indicator for monitoring mortality in the hurricane’s aftermath.” Researchers also looked at which communities were hardest-hit by the hurricane, which could inform how the island prepares for future disasters. The study found the risk of death was 45 percent higher for populations living in poorer municipalities. “The results of our epidemiological study suggest that, tragically, Hurricane Maria led to a large number of excess deaths throughout the island. Certain groups ― those in lower income areas and the elderly ― faced the highest risk,” said Carlos Santos-Burgoa, the study’s principal investigator, in a statement. He added: “We hope this report and its recommendations will help build the island’s resilience and pave the way toward a plan that will protect all sectors of society in times of natural disasters.” In an interview in Spanish with El Nuevo Día responding to the report, Roselló acknowledged his government’s failings in establishing an effective protocol for measuring the death toll.

In a speech in Glasgow, the MSP called for \"modern forms of democratic planning in the economy\" which tap into workers' expertise and experience. Mr Leonard's speech was a response to the SNP's \"growth commission\" on the economics of an independent Scotland. The SNP said Labour was \"hopelessly consumed by chaos and conflicting positions on Brexit\". Scotland's parties have been setting out their own economic visions in the wake of the growth commission report, which also made policy recommendations for the current constitutional arrangement. New forecasts from the Scottish Fiscal Commission have also suggested that the country is set for five years of \"subdued\" growth, with wages not due to rise in real terms until 2020. 'Economic planning' Speaking at an event confirming Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath MP Lesley Laird as his deputy, Mr Leonard said there needed to be more forward planning in the economy, with an industrial strategy which does not just \"lurch from one defensive rescue to the next\". He said: \"We need democracy in our economy, not just when things go wrong, but to help things go right in the first place. \"Let me be clear about this: as far as the Labour party is concerned trade unions have a central role to play in the new economy, not just defending their members, but using their members' knowledge, skills and capacities to plan for the future. \"In our industrial strategy, we want to show people that through a new approach to long-term investment by unleashing innovation and the ingenuity of working people we can herald a renaissance in our manufacturing industries.\" Image copyright Getty Images Constitutional questions over Brexit and independence have come to the fore in Scottish politics The Scottish Labour leader also said \"redrawing lines on a map\" would not create a fairer Scotland, instead calling for \"a rebalanced economy and a redistribution of wealth, power and opportunity\". He said: \"We need to stop dividing people on the basis of nationality, and start uniting people on the basis of class to bring about real change.\" This was echoed by Ms Laird in her speech. She said \"constant debates about structure, process and the constitution have paralysed the Scottish economy\", and added that it was \"time for a different conversation\". A spokesman for the SNP said Labour talking about unity \"would be laughable if it were not so serious\", saying the party was \"hopelessly consumed by chaos and conflicting positions on Brexit\". He added: \"It is the SNP government in Scotland, and in opposition in Westminster, that is stepping up to the mark and working to protect the economy, jobs and the livelihoods of families across the country. \"The growth commission has opened up a lively and encouraging discussion over the path that Scotland can take. \"It offers a refreshed approach based on the importance of investment to stimulate Scotland's economy, an end to austerity and a plan for a progressive Scotland.\" The Scottish Conservatives, meanwhile, contend that the UK government has been doing better work on the economy than the devolved administration at Holyrood. Finance spokesman Murdo Fraser said: \"The contrast between the UK government's progress and the dismal performance of the Scottish economy relative to that in the rest of the UK after 11 years of this Scottish government could not be more stark. \"Last year, our economy grew at half the rate of that in the rest of the UK, and more slowly than the economies of every single European Union country.\".

{"global_context": "The guilty plea of Trump’s former campaign chairman sheds light on a 2012 dirty-trick campaign targeting “[O]bama jews.”. Ukrainian politician Yulia Tymoshenko, shown in 2014, was the target of a smear campaign by Paul Manafort, new U.S. court records show. (Vasily Fedosenko/Reuters) Paul Manafort’s guilty plea Friday came with new evidence of a dirty-tricks campaign involving a jailed Ukrainian opposition politician, the Israeli government, a U.S. official who appears to be then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and what Manafort allegedly called “[O]bama jews.” The complicated 2012 scheme amounted to an effort to smear the Ukrainian politician, Yulia Tymoshenko, as an anti-Semite, according to court documents filed Friday in the Manafort case. Tymoshenko was then in jail, and Clinton was among the international critics who suggested that Manafort’s pro-Russian client, then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, had put her there. Tymoshenko’s political party was standing in parliamentary elections in October 2012, and Manafort bragged in documents cited by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III that he could “plant some stink” on her. Manafort pleaded guilty to two criminal charges and has pledged to cooperate with Mueller’s probe of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and whether any Trump associates may have conspired with Moscow. His 2012 plan was an effort to “tarnish Tymoshenko in the United States” and pressure the Obama administration to distance itself from her, according to an outline released by prosecutors Friday. The plan does not appear to have worked. Tymoshenko’s party did well in the 2012 elections, and she is planning a presidential run next year. In addition, the Obama administration continued to criticize Yanukovych and to call Tymoshenko’s prosecution unfair. Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, shown in February, pleaded guilty to criminal charges Friday as part of a cooperation deal with prosecutors. (Yuri Gripas/Reuters) [Inside a Russian disinformation campaign in Ukraine in 2014] Manafort “orchestrated a scheme to have, as he wrote in a contemporaneous communication, ‘[O]bama jews’ put pressure on the Administration to disavow Tymoshenko and support Yanukovych,” prosecutors wrote. Manafort “sought to undermine United States support for Tymoshenko by spreading stories in the United States that a senior Cabinet official (who had been a prominent critic of Yanukovych’s treatment of Tymoshenko) was supporting anti-Semitism because the official supported Tymoshenko, who in turn had formed a political alliance with a Ukraine party that espoused anti-Semitic views,” the charging document said. That official seems likely to have been Clinton, who was then finishing her four-year term as secretary of state and had become a vocal critic of what she called anti-democratic currents in Ukraine. The arguments pushed by Manafort match those in an article published on the Breitbart News right-wing website attacking Clinton. A spokesman for Clinton did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday. Then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton meets with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in New York on Sept. 19, 2016. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post) The smear-by-association was based on a political alliance that Tymoshenko’s party had formed with a movement known as Svoboda, or Freedom, which had been associated with anti-Semitic views. Manafort “coordinated privately with a senior Israeli government official to issue a written statement publicizing this story” and “then, with secret advance knowledge of that Israeli statement, worked to disseminate this story in the United States,” prosecutors claim. Manafort wrote at the time that “I have someone pushing it on the NY Post. Bada bing bada boom,” the document says. [Manafort pleads guilty to two charges and will cooperate with Mueller] Manafort’s goal was “to have the Administration understand that ‘the Jewish community will take this out on Obama on election day if he does nothing,’ ” prosecutors wrote, quoting contemporaneous writings. The New York Post apparently did not bite, but an article did appear on Breitbart outlining the ties between Tymoshenko’s party and Svoboda, and quoting a statement from Israel’s top diplomat at the time, Avigdor Liberman. “One prominent Jewish leader, who asked to remain unnamed, says that Clinton’s New York Times op-ed ripping the current Ukrainian administration has ‘created a neo-Nazi Frankenstein by issuing a de facto endorsement of Mrs. Tymoshenko and her choices,’ ” the Breitbart article said. The Oct. 27, 2012, statement from the Israeli Foreign Ministry said the country was “concerned about the growing extremist anti-Semitic forces in Ukraine” and cited the partnership agreement. “Israel is concerned about the recently signed agreement between the Batkivshchyna Party and the extremist Freedom Party, whose anti-Semitic attacks repeatedly aroused resentment both in Ukraine and in Israel,” the statement from Liberman’s office read. The Svoboda political movement “glorified” what it called “the struggle against the Muscovites and Jews,” the statement said. “The expression of such views resembles the dark pages of the history of the last century, which led humanity to the tragedy of the Second World War. Israel condemns anti-Semitic manifestations of any kind and expresses the hope that common sense prevails.” The Israeli statement came three days after Clinton and the European Union foreign affairs minister published an op-ed in the New York Times that mentioned Tymoshenko by name. “We regret that the convictions of opposition leaders during trials that did not meet international standards are preventing them from standing in parliamentary elections,” Clinton and the European Union’s Catherine Ashton wrote. “The Ukrainian government needs to address these selective prosecutions, including the case of former Prime Minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko and other former senior officials.” Loveday Morris and Ruth Eglash in Jerusalem contributed to this report.

{"global_context": "The plan, hatched by White House chief of staff John F. Kelly, is expected to be set in motion over the next few weeks. The White House has a plan to replace Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with CIA Director Mike Pompeo, after months of rockiness between Tillerson and President Trump. (The Washington Post) The White House has readied a plan to oust embattled Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and replace him with CIA Director Mike Pompeo, who has become one of the most personally loyal and politically savvy members of President Trump's national security team, two administration officials confirmed Thursday. The plan, hatched by White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, is expected to be set in motion over the next few weeks, and it has broad support within Trump's inner circle, the officials said. But it was unclear whether Trump had signed off on the plan yet; the president has been known to change his mind about personnel and other matters before finalizing decisions with public announcements. Under the plan, Pompeo would probably be replaced at the CIA by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), one of Trump's most steadfast defenders and a confidant to some leading members of the foreign policy team, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the White House has not publicly announced the moves. Left: Mike Pompeo at a Senate confirmation hearing to be CIA director (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post). Secretary of State Rex Tillerson speaks about North Korea during the White House daily press briefing on Nov. 20 (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post). The New York Times was the first to report Kelly's plan. Asked during a Thursday morning meeting with the crown prince of Bahrain, Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, whether he wants Tillerson to remain as secretary of state, Trump told reporters: “He's here. Rex is here.” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders did not dispute the reporting of the plan to replace Tillerson, but she noted that Tillerson remains in his job and is working to “close out what has been a successful year.” Asked at her afternoon news briefing whether Trump has confidence in Tillerson, Sanders would not answer explicitly. “When the president loses confidence in someone, they will no longer serve in the capacity that they’re in,” she said. In an earlier statement, Sanders told reporters: “There are no personnel announcements at this time.” As for how Tillerson can serve effectively as the nation's top diplomat amid doubts about his longevity, Sanders told reporters, “The secretary of state’s a pretty tough guy, and I think he’ll be just fine carrying his job out.” At the State Department, meanwhile, spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Tillerson is going about his job as usual, including two visits to the White House on Thursday. She said Kelly called Tillerson's office on Thursday morning to say reports about the White House replacing him were “not true.” “Secretary Tillerson enjoys this job. He has a lot of work to do,” Nauert said. She added, “He does serve at the pleasure of the president.” Asked about her boss's relationship with Trump, Nauert said: “The president respects Secretary Tillerson. The have had, certainly, a cordial relationship. Where that stands today, I cannot speak to that.” A spokesperson for Pompeo at the CIA declined to comment. And as for Cotton, the senator's spokesman, Caroline Rabbitt Tabler, said, “Senator Cotton's focus is on serving Arkansans in the Senate.” [‘Death spiral’: Tillerson makes nice but may not last long with Trump] Throughout this autumn, Tillerson's departure has been widely expected, given his rocky relationship with the president, and Pompeo has been seen as a top contender to succeed Tillerson at Foggy Bottom. Chatter about Tillerson's potential ouster reached a fever pitch in October, after NBC News reported that Tillerson had called Trump a “moron.” Though Tillerson had told friends he wanted to make it as secretary of state for a full year and has insisted publicly that he had no plans to quit, rumors of his impending departure gained a nickname — Rexit. The secretary of state has alienated both onetime allies at the White House and his underlings at the State Department with what many call a highhanded and tone-deaf manner. Tillerson’s main project, a downsizing and streamlining of the State Department bureaucracy, is still a work in progress, but it has drawn widespread criticism on Capitol Hill, from leading congressional Republicans as well as Democrats. President Trump and his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson have been on shaky ground for weeks, and Trump's challenge of an 'IQ test' face-off with Tillerson isn't smoothing things over. Here's a look back at where their relationship derailed. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) Tillerson's closest ally in Washington may be Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who spoke with Tillerson on Thursday and later dismissed reports about the secretary's departure. Corker suggested that Tillerson's rivals inside the administration were “seeking to undermine his presence.” “I don't think Secretary Tillerson's getting ready to be ousted,” Corker told reporters, noting that Tillerson talked with Trump on Thursday morning on a diplomatic call with another world leader. “It's been evident to me that, for some time, somebody has been seeking to undermine his presence. I don't know who that is.” Corker — who was considered for the secretary of state job a year ago but whose relationship with Trump has been badly strained in recent months — said of Tillerson's possible replacement, “I could barely pick Pompeo out of a lineup.” Corker added: “I just don't know him. That's not dismissive. I just don't have any frame of reference.” Pompeo, 53, has developed a close rapport with Trump through the president's regular intelligence briefings, which Pompeo often delivers personally in the Oval Office. A graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and Harvard Law School, Pompeo served in Congress for six years as a Republican representing a Kansas district. He was first elected in 2010 as part of the tea party wave. Tillerson, 65, had never worked in government and was largely unfamiliar with Washington when he accepted a surprise job offer from then President-elect Trump late last year. He had spent his entire professional career at ExxonMobil, where as chief executive officer he built a reputation as a shrewd dealmaker, with contacts across the Middle East and in Moscow. He famously accepted an honorary friendship medal directly from Russian President Vladimir Putin. As secretary of state, Tillerson has been frustrated by the slow pace and inefficiency of government, as well as what he has complained to friends is a culture of backstabbing and self-aggrandizement. At one point, Tillerson's likely successor appeared to be U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, a Republican and former governor from South Carolina, who has clashed with Tillerson. Over the past several weeks, however, both Haley and White House officials signaled that she would not likely be chosen to succeed Tillerson, in part because she is seen as not yet seasoned enough for the top diplomatic post. Haley insisted last month that she does not want the job and would reject it if it were offered. Tillerson accompanied Trump on part of his Asian trip earlier this month, and the pair gave no obvious sign of estrangement. Tillerson has kept up a steady schedule of appearances, including a speech Tuesday at the Woodrow Wilson Center in which he said the United States and European allies recognize the “active threat of a recently resurgent Russia.” Tillerson has stressed the importance of attempting dialogue and diplomacy with North Korea, even as Trump undercut him by saying the time for talk is over and that North Korea’s leadership only understands the threat of force. On Wednesday morning, Tillerson told reporters that a “long list” of additional sanctions could still be applied to attempt to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. “As a diplomat, we keep working on it every day,” Tillerson said of the nonmilitary pressure campaign. On Wednesday afternoon, Trump again belittled North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as “Little rocket man” and a “sick puppy.” Cotton, meanwhile, has emerged as perhaps the senator most closely aligned with the White House on national security issues. Older and more senior Republican colleagues, including national security lions Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Corker, have been frequent critics of Trump policies and priorities. Cotton was the central congressional figure in the White House plan, unveiled last month, to back away from the Iran nuclear deal and throw the question of U.S. participation in the international agreement to Congress. Should Cotton be nominated and confirmed as CIA director, he would leave a Senate seat vacant in a reliably Republican state. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is said to prefer for Cotton to remain in the Senate but would not try to stand in his way should the Arkansan want the CIA post, according to one McConnell ally who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid. Republican operatives began considering who would make strong potential replacements for Cotton, should the plan come to fruition. Names being mentioned included Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin, U.S. Reps. Steve Womack and French Hill, and state Attorney General Leslie Rutledge. Josh Dawsey, Karoun Demirjian, Sean Sullivan and Greg Miller contributed to this report.

{"global_context": "Alan Dershowitz offers his argument against impeaching the president. Follow qjurecic Quinta Jurecic is the deputy managing editor of Lawfare. Quinta Jurecic is the managing editor of Lawfare. In the past year, three books have made the case that President Trump has committed offenses so dire that he might constitutionally be impeached and removed from office. The authors differ in how they approach the question: Allan J. Lichtman (“The Case for Impeachment”) tackles it head-on; Laurence Tribe and Joshua Matz (“To End a Presidency”) build a case against the president but caution against moving too hastily; Cass Sunstein (“Impeachment: A Citizen’s Guide”) weighs a range of hypotheticals but fastidiously refrains from mentioning Trump’s name. Now comes Alan Dershowitz with his book “The Case Against Impeaching Trump.” From the title, the reasonable reader might expect the former law professor — whose television appearances defending the president, or at least criticizing his detractors, have become increasingly unavoidable — to present a sustained response to the arguments of his fellow authors. This is true for roughly the first 30 pages. The rest of the 150-page book is bulked out by copies of Dershowitz’s op-eds and columns, transcripts of his various television appearances, and — strangest of all — a series of his tweets. The result is a strange jumble that is less a legal argument against impeaching Trump and more a scrapbook of what Dershowitz has been up to for the past year. Dershowitz has lightly edited his short writings in the interest of linking them together into a volume. He refers to them here as “essays,” which is something of an overstatement: Most are no more than two or three pages in length. (By my count, only one of the 28 pieces, in addition to the introduction, appears to have been written originally for this book.) Relatively few of them are about impeachment per se, and some have nothing to do with the Russia investigation at all. One, first published as a Wall Street Journal op-ed, was written in response to Trump’s comments on the violence in Charlottesville. Some chapters involve reflections on evergreen topics — Dershowitz’s desire for a nonpartisan congressional commission to investigate election interference, for example, and his belief that civil libertarians (except him) have sold out their ideals because they want to bring down the president. But others are so closely pegged to developments that were in the news when Dershowitz first penned them that they make for odd reading in the summer of 2018. In one piece, originally written in July 2017, Dershowitz points to the overturning of Sheldon Silver’s corruption conviction to argue against “an extraordinarily broad definition of corruption capable of being expanded to fit nearly everything Trump has done.” But Silver, former speaker of the New York State Assembly, was found guilty again on the same set of charges in May. This isn’t necessarily fatal to Dershowitz’s argument, but it’s a glaring omission. To the extent that the body of the book speaks to any coherent theme, Dershowitz expresses consistent concern over alleged overreach on the part of the special counsel’s office, as well as what he sees as a loss of civility in American political discourse. These two concerns often bleed into one another. A chapter on why Dershowitz distrusts allegations of Trump’s “corrupt motive” in dismissing FBI director James Comey — something prosecutors would need to show in bringing an obstruction case — somehow transforms into a list of angry emails he has received for his defense of the president. The overall impression is that Dershowitz understands his own martyrdom (yes, there is mention of Martha’s Vineyard, where, Dershowitz has argued, his friends now snub him) as a proxy for the supposed injustices of the Mueller investigation. But “McCarthyism,” which Dershowitz likes to invoke, is a long way from the social opprobrium he claims to experience. Some of the writings Dershowitz includes speak to his theory that the president cannot obstruct justice solely by exercising powers within his constitutional authority. (So firing Comey could not in itself constitute obstruction, for example; firing Comey in exchange for a bribe could.) His is certainly a minority position, though it could be brought within the realm of reasonable disagreement by writers more careful and nuanced than Dershowitz. The same is true of the arguments set forth in the book’s opening essay on impeachment. The Constitution mandates that a president may be impeached only for “high Crimes and Misdemeanors” — but what exactly does that mean? The vast majority of scholars and jurists who have tackled the topic have argued that while a criminal act may be an impeachable offense, an impeachable offense need not be a crime. Dershowitz takes the opposite approach, which, in combination with his limited reading of the obstruction statutes, has the effect of severely constraining the universe of offenses for which Trump could be removed from office. To Dershowitz’s credit, he recognizes the bizarre outcomes his position would generate: Even if a hypothetical president chose to stand by while Vladimir Putin reclaimed Alaska as Russian territory, Dershowitz argues, that president could not be impeached. (Compare this with the constitutional scholar Charles Black, who in 1974 defined “high crimes and misdemeanors” as offenses that “corrupt or subvert the political and governmental process” and that are “plainly wrong in themselves to a person of honor.” Handing over Alaska would seem to fall into this category.) What if the House were to impeach and the Senate to convict a president for an offense that was not itself a crime? In that case, Dershowitz argues, the Supreme Court would be constitutionally empowered to overturn the impeachment. Most scholars have rejected this argument on the grounds of absurdity; the exception is the scholar of impeachment Raoul Berger, whose detailed study of the matter is a far better introduction to the constitutional question than Dershowitz’s glib treatment. The president, of course, is not going to read Berger’s study of impeachment anytime soon. What he has done instead is tweet an endorsement of Dershowitz’s “new and very important book . . . which I would encourage all people with Trump Derangement Syndrome to read!” What is there to be said about the fact that the president of the United States is providing free advertising for a book that argues against his removal from the White House? What guidance, if any, can or should the Constitution provide at the point when the mismatch between man and office becomes so obvious as to be grotesque? There are serious questions to be asked about how to understand the relationship between Trump and the founding documents of this country, but Dershowitz is not serious about answering them.

{"global_context": "WASHINGTON — Faced with biting public criticism from Republican Sen.-elect Mitt Romney, President Donald Trump pushed back Wednesday, reminding him that “I won big, and he didn’t.” Days away from joining the Senate’s Republican majority, Romney broadly criticized Trump’s policies and character in a newspaper column, arguing that the president “has not risen to the mantle of the office.” “With the nation so divided, resentful and angry, presidential leadership in qualities of character is indispensable,” the Utah Republican and 2012 presidential nominee wrote in a Washington Post op-ed posted online Tuesday night. “And it is in this province where the incumbent’s shortfall has been most glaring.” Trump fired back on Twitter, saying early Wednesday: “Here we go with Mitt Romney, but so fast! Question will be, is he a Flake? I hope not. Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other things where he can be helpful.” Trump’s warning shot referred to retiring Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who has been Trump’s most consistent critic among Senate Republicans. As he and other critics leave Congress, it is an open question who — if anyone — will take up the role of publicly criticizing a president who remains popular with Republican voters. Romney’s biting public assessment came as Trump and Senate Republicans faced a new governing dynamic. Republicans on Thursday will cede control of the House to Democrats, who were prepared to oppose Trump on a number of policies and promised a slew of investigations into his actions and those of his aides and campaign officials, particularly with regard to Russia’s election meddling. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, had criticized Trump before — notably, in a March 2016 speech he called Trump a “fraud” and opposed his bid for the GOP nomination — but later he made peace with the president-elect and even expressed interest in joining his administration. Romney’s rebuke of Trump drew a cutting reply from Brad Parscale, Trump’s campaign manager. In a tweet Tuesday night, Parscale said Romney “lacked the ability to save this nation” and contended that Trump “has saved it.” “Jealously is a drink best served warm and Romney just proved it,” Parscale wrote, adding he wished “everyone had the courage” Trump had. In the column, Romney offered approval of Trump’s corporate tax policies and efforts to cut regulations, appoint conservative judges and other “policies mainstream Republicans have promoted for years. But policies and appointments are only a part of a presidency.” “To a great degree, a presidency shapes the public character of the nation,” Romney said. He later added: “With the nation so divided, resentful and angry, presidential leadership in qualities of character is indispensable. And it is in this province where the incumbent’s shortfall has been most glaring.” While saying Trump’s early administration appointments had been encouraging, Romney added that, “on balance, his conduct over the past two years, particularly his actions this month, is evidence that the president has not risen to the mantle of the office.” In describing a “deep descent” by the Trump presidency in December, Romney cited the departures of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and White House chief of staff John Kelly and what he called the appointment of people of lesser experience, the abandonment of allies, and Trump’s “thoughtless claim that America has long been a ‘sucker’ in world affairs.” Looking ahead, Romney wrote that he would act as he would with any president from either party in the White House, supporting policies he believes are in the best interest of the country and his state and opposing those that are not. And he said he didn’t intend to comment on every tweet or fault. “But I will speak out against significant statements or actions that are divisive, racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions,” he said. Romney will be sworn in as a senator on Thursday.

{"global_context": "Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed special counsel Robert Mueller, will leave the Justice Department after a tumultuous two years. CLOSE Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has submitted a letter of resignation to President Donald Trump. Time, Time WASHINGTON – Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, whose tumultuous tenure at the Justice Department was defined by his management of the sprawling investigation into Russian election interference, announced his departure Monday after two years in which he was often the target of President Donald Trump's scorn. Rosenstein, whose exit has been expected for months, submitted a resignation letter to the president in which he offered both gratitude to Trump and veiled references to the extraordinary challenges posed by the investigation that shadowed the first two years of Trump's administration. \"I am grateful to you for the opportunity to serve; for the courtesy and humor you often display in our personal conversations; and for the goals you set in your inaugural address: patriotism, unity, safety, education and prosperty,\" Rosenstein wrote Monday. His resignation is set to take effect May 11. Rosenstein's praise for the president comes less than two weeks after Russia special counsel Robert Mueller delivered a scathing account of Trump's conduct in which he repeatedly sought to limit or derail the investigation. While Mueller did not resolve whether Trump's actions were criminal, Rosenstein and Attorney General William Barr determined that there was insufficient evidence to charge the president with obstruction of justice. The investigation found that the Russian government launched a \"sweeping and systematic\" effort to intercede in the 2016 election and help Trump win the White House and that his campaign welcomed the assistance, but it did not find sufficient evidence to show that Trump or his aides conspired in the effort. The investigation – and its conclusions – have been a fraught and partisan issue since Trump's first days in office. \"We enforce the law without fear or favor because credible evidence is not partisan and truth is not determined by opinion polls,\" Rosenstein said in his letter. \"We ignore fleeting distractions and focus our attention on the things that matter, because a repoublic that endures is not governed by the news cycle.\" He also appeared to defend the inquiry that Trump has castigated as a \"coup,\" and for which Trump subjected him to public insults. \"Our nation is safer, our elections are more secure, and our citizens are better informed about covert foreign influence efforts,\" he wrote. Then he quoted Thomas Paine: \"Those who expect to reap the blessings of freedom must undergo the fatigues of supporting it.\" A career federal prosecutor, Rosenstein was thrust into an unusually public role for the agency's second-in-command almost immediately after taking office when then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself in the midst of the Russia inquiry. Sessions' disqualification ceded authority for the extraordinary investigation into whether the president's campaign conspired with the Kremlin to his 54-year-old deputy. Among his first actions as deputy attorney general, Rosenstein authored a memorandum that Trump used as the basis for firing then-FBI Director James Comey. Trump's abrupt action later became part of Mueller's examination of whether the president sought to obstruct the Russia probe. Comey's firing so shook public confidence in the Russia inquiry that just days later Rosenstein appointed Mueller, a former FBI director, to lead the investigation as a Justice Department special counsel. Throughout his tenure, Rosenstein often found himself in the middle of a politically-charged battle in which Trump and congressional allies cast the deputy attorney general as a ringleader in partisan \"witch-hunt\" while Democrats came to view the Republican as an unlikely guard against White House interference. Rosenstein noted in a New York speech April 25 that the Obama administration chose not to publicize the full story of Russian computer hackers and social-media trolls attempting to undermine the country. The FBI disclosed classified information about the inquiry to lawmakers, which was then leaked to reporters. The FBI director alleged that Trump pressured him to close the investigation, but the president denied the conversation occurred. \"So that happened,\" Rosenstein said. \"But the bottom line is, there was overwhelming evidence that Russian operatives hacked American computers and defrauded American citizens, and that is only the tip of the iceberg of a comprehensive Russian strategy to influence elections, promote social discord, and undermine America, just like they do in many other countries.\" Mueller's investigation concluded March 22 when Mueller submitted his confidential report to William Barr. The inquiry did not establish that Trump or his campaign had coordinated with Russian efforts to influence the election. Although the special counsel did not resolve the issue of whether Trump obstructed justice, Barr and Rosenstein concluded that the president's conduct was not criminal. Rosenstein rarely responded to the the president's criticisms even when their differences made him a likely target for dismissal. Indeed, Rosenstein had considered resigning from his post last year in the wake of a New York Times report indicating that the deputy attorney general suggested invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump. Rosenstein strongly denied the report, which indicated that he suggested recording Trump's conversations in hopes of triggering the president's removal from office. The incident prompted a hastily-called White House meeting where Rosenstein expected to be fired – only to return to the Justice Department later that day with his status unchanged. While at the White House, Rosenstein spoke by telephone with Trump who at the time was attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York. The two reached an apparent understanding that Trump later acknowledged. “My preference would be to keep him, and to let him finish up,” Trump said about Rosenstein, adding once again that the investigation “is a witch hunt.” While the deputy attorney general's relationship with Trump was often uncertain, Rosenstein was a steady defender of Mueller and repeatedly assured lawmakers that the special counsel was proceeding appropriately. After meeting with top members of the Senate Judiciary Committee in June 2018 – Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. – Rosenstein thanked them for their commitment \"to follow the facts wherever they lead without any improper outside interference.\" He said agents and prosecutors would base decisions on neutral standards and credible evidence, while completing the inquiry \"as promptly as is feasible.\" \"I'm very confident that when the history of this era is written, it will reflect that the department was operated with integrity,” Rosenstein told USA TODAY during a rare interview in March 2018. Trump nominated Jeffrey Rosen, the current deputy secretary at the Transportation Department, on March 26 to succeed Rosenstein. Career prosecutor Rosenstein had been a career attorney at the Justice Department before taking the No. 2 post. He graduated with highest honors from the University of Pennsylvania with a degree in economics and then earned a law degree from Harvard, where he was an editor of the law review. He clerked for D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Douglas Ginsburg. Rosenstein joined the department in 1990 through the attorney general’s honors program, and he prosecuted corruption case with the criminal division before taking a succession of roles in the department's headquarters. In the 1990s, he joined independent counsel Kenneth Starr’s investigation of President Bill Clinton. Rosenstein helped convict three onetime associates of the Clintons – Susan McDougal, James McDougal and former Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker – on fraud and conspiracy charges in May 1996. Former President George W. Bush appointed Rosenstein the U.S. attorney in Maryland in 2005 and former President Barack Obama kept in place to 2017. Trump made him deputy attorney general, setting Rosenstein up for his biggest clash yet. In his letter, Rosenstein said the Justice Department \"bears a special responsibility to avoid partisanship.\" \"Political considerations may influence policy choices, but neutral principles must drive decisions about individual cases,\" Rosenstein wrote, He quoted former attorneys general Robert Jackson, Edward Levi and John Ashcroft, all of whom have called for a Justice Department governed by impartiality and fairness. \"We enforce the law without fear or favor because credible evidence is not partisan, and truth is not determined by opinion polls,\" he wrote. \"We ignore fleeting distractions and focus our attention on the things that matter, because a republic that endures is not governed by the news cycle.\" Barr, who was attorney general under former President George H.W. Bush and returned to the post under the Trump administration, praised Rosenstein for his nearly 30 years with the Justice Department. “Over the course of his distinguished government career, he has navigated many challenging situations with strength, grace, and good humor. Rod has been an invaluable partner to me during my return to the Department, and I have relied heavily on his leadership and judgment over the past several months. I have appreciated the opportunity to work closely with him, and I wish him well in his future endeavors,\" Barr said in a statement. A presidential target Rosenstein's relationship with the president was fraught almost from the start. Thirteen days after Rosenstein was sworn in, Trump fired Comey, a decision that provoked a partisan uproar and that the White House initially said was based on a recommendation from the new deputy attorney general. (Trump later said it wasn't.) Comey's firing ultimately prompted Mueller's appointment. “I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt,” Trump tweeted in June 2017. I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 16, 2017 Trump, who ousted Sessions the day after the November 2018 midterm election, repeatedly criticized Sessions, Comey, Rosenstein and Mueller for their roles in the probe. In April 2018, Trump again called it a “Fake & Corrupt Russia Investigation, head up by the all Democrat loyalists, or people that worked for Obama. Mueller is most conflicted of all (except Rosenstein who signed FISA & Comey letter). No Collusion, so they go crazy!” Much of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the Fake & Corrupt Russia Investigation, headed up by the all Democrat loyalists, or people that worked for Obama. Mueller is most conflicted of all (except Rosenstein who signed FISA & Comey letter). No Collusion, so they go crazy! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 11, 2018 Lawmakers joined the fray. By February 2018, Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee released a report that documented that Rosenstein signed an application for a surveillance warrant targeting former Trump campaign aide Carter Page, as had Comey and two other deputy attorneys general. The criticism from House Republicans occasionally became heated. At a House Judiciary Committee hearing June 28, Republicans accused Rosenstein of hiding documents and argued that the 13-month investigation had already taken too long. \"We caught you hiding information!\" said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. Rosenstein wagged a finger at the congressman seated to his left, calling his remarks \"deeply wrong.\" \"It's not accurate, sir,\" Rosenstein said. \"I am not hiding anything from you.” Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., expressed his frustration with the Mueller investigation. \"Whatever you got, finish it the hell up!\" Gowdy implored, adding that the inquiry was \"tearing the country apart.\" \"I want him (Mueller) to finish the investigation as expeditiously as possible,\" Rosenstein responded. Rosenstein acknowledged in his April 25 speech that not everybody was happy with the investigation. But he said it helps to keep a sense of humor in Washington because politicians evaluate issues in terms of immediate impact and mercenary critics are paid to express passionate opinions. \"They make threats, spread fake stories, and even attack your relatives,\" Rosenstein said of professional provocateurs. \"My job is to enforce the law in a non-partisan way; that is the whole point of the oath of office.\" Read or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/29/deputy-attorney-general-rod-rosenstein-resigns-after-russia-probe-ends/1605373002/.

{"global_context": "Public Citizen filed the complaints alleging likely violations of ethics rules that Trump himself announced just days into his presidency. Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE A prominent government watchdog group has filed 30 ethics complaints with various federal agencies — including the White House — alleging that employees are working in violation of President Donald Trump's executive order intended to \"drain the swamp\" and keep government free of former lobbyists. The group, Public Citizen, filed the complaints in recent days, charging possible violations of ethics rules that Trump announced just days into his presidency. The complaints, obtained by NBC News, cite Executive Order No. 13770, which effectively barred former lobbyists from being appointed, without a waiver, to governmental positions in which they would manage issues they'd lobbied on within the past two years. Last summer, Public Citizen identified 36 lobbyists who'd been tapped for government jobs dealing with issues they'd lobbied on, and only six of those appointees have received waivers since then, the group said. \"These 30 apparent violations of Trump's own ethics rules are only the tip of the iceberg,\" said Craig Holman, co-author of the June 2017 report and lobbyist for Public Citizen's Congress Watch division. Holman added that the Trump administration had issued the waivers only to appointees whose apparent violations had received attention and scrutiny through media reports. One individual cited by Public Citizen was Byron Anderson, a special assistant to the Secretary of Labor, who the group said \"appears to be working on the same specific issue areas he had lobbied on within the last two years, and has not received a waiver from the ethics rules.\" According to Anderson's LinkedIn profile, he worked as a vice president, federal affairs at a firm called Transamerica until January 2017. Another individual cited for the same reason was Andrew Wheeler, who worked as a lobbyist for the coal industry as recently as May 2017, according to Bloomberg News. The group also filed complaints citing employees at the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Health and Human Services, Commerce, Interior, Energy, Education, Agriculture, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency and the White House Office of Management and Budget. Public Citizen has sent the complaints to ethics officers at each agency where the appointees are working, requesting that they investigate. The White House has not responded to a request for comment. \"The bottom line is that neither Trump nor his administration take conflicts of interest and ethics seriously,\" said Lisa Gilbert, vice president of legislative affairs for Public Citizen. \"'Drain the swamp' was far more campaign rhetoric than a commitment to ethics, and the widespread lack of compliance and enforcement of Trump's ethics executive order shows that ethics do not matter in the Trump administration.\" Trump has come under frequent criticism from watchdog and oversight groups, as well as Democrats, for not making good on the promise to make government a lobbyist-free zone. Many of the president's Cabinet heads and aides have routinely raised legal and ethical questions. For example, former Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price resigned after just eight months on the job amid a public outcry over his use of private jets to conduct government business, which cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have also come under scrutiny for paying for the use of private jets with taxpayer money.

{"global_context": "No one at the U.S. Department of Defense is providing counterintelligence support to protect against threats to America’s infrastructure. The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) did not assign anyone to provide counterintelligence (CI) support to protect against threats to America’s defense critical infrastructure such as “chemical facilities and nuclear power systems,” the Pentagon’s office of the inspector general (OIG) recently reported. OIG officials determined in an audit published April 5 that “as a result, DoD CI support … may not consistently identify CI threats to essential DoD services and infrastructure.” The inspector general’s (IG) findings came days before ARS Technica reported on Wednesday that America’s adversaries are using a “mysterious safety-tampering malware” to try to sabotage critical infrastructures across the United States such as power plants and gas refineries. In the recent audit, Pentagon investigators primarily assessed if the Pentagon had “assigned responsibilities for counterintelligence (CI) support … to protect defense critical infrastructure.” The IG explained: The Department of Homeland Security defines critical infrastructure as “essential services that underpin American society,” such as energy systems, banking, and finance systems, chemical facilities … and nuclear power systems. Critical infrastructure is defined as assets so vital that their exploitation, incapacitation, or destruction would have a debilitating effect on national security, the U.S. economy, public health or safety, or any combination thereof. Pentagon OIG officials noted that the 2003 Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-7 mandated that federal departments and agencies “identify, prioritize, and coordinate the protection of critical infrastructure and key resources in order to prevent, deter, and mitigate the effects of deliberate efforts to destroy, incapacitate, or exploit them.” The directive came a couple of years after al-Qaeda jihadis, with the help of the Afghan Taliban, carried out the September 11 attacks on the American homeland, including the Pentagon building. DOD officials are required to meet the directive’s requirements. However, the IG found that the Pentagon “did not assign responsibilities for CI [counterintelligence] coverage of critical assets and facilities.” The IG found that defense infrastructure sector lead agents (DISLAs) had been responsible for providing counterintelligence support for protecting critical infrastructure. However, a 2016 DOD directive eliminated the DISLA positions and the Pentagon “has not yet updated DoD’ instructions ‘to assign CI responsibilities that were previously aligned to support DISLAs and their corresponding sectors.’” “We recommend that the Director for Defense Intelligence (Intelligence and Security), Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, revise all applicable DoD policies to ensure the protection of essential DoD services and infrastructure,” the IG declared. In a response to the audit, Pentagon officials “agreed with the recommendation,” adding that the department will make the appropriate changes by April 2020 “to ensure that counterintelligence responsibilities are aligned to critical asset owners.” On Wednesday, ARS Technica noted: Sixteen months ago, researchers reported an unsettling escalation in hacks targeting power plants, gas refineries, and other types of critical infrastructure. Attackers who may have been working on behalf of a nation caused an operational outage at a critical-infrastructure site after deliberately targeting a system that prevented health- and life-threatening accidents. There had been compromises of critical infrastructure sites before. What was unprecedented in this attack—and of considerable concern to some researchers and critical infrastructure operators—was the use of an advanced piece of malware that targeted the unidentified site’s safety processes. In its latest Worldwide Threat Assessment, the U.S. intelligence community warned that American rivals like China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea are intent on using cyber operations “to disrupt critical infrastructure.” “China has the ability to launch cyber attacks that cause localized, temporary disruptive effects on critical infrastructure—such as disruption of a natural gas pipeline for days to weeks—in the United States,” it added. Transnational organized criminals like Mexican drug cartels are also “threatening critical infrastructure,” the report also said. While China and Russia continue to pose the top intelligence threats to American interests, Iran and Cuba also represent a “persistent” menace, the assessment determined, adding, “Geopolitical, societal, and technological changes will increase opportunities for foreign intelligence services and other entities—such as terrorists, criminals, and cyber actors—to collect on US activities and information to the detriment of US interests.”.

The U.S. has demanded that Iran end its support for terror proxies in Syria and stop its nuclear and ballistic missile development in order to see the sanctions lifted. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the sanctions are “aimed at fundamentally altering the behavior of the Islamic Republic of Iran.” France, Germany, Britain and the European Union condemned the U.S. move, issuing a joint statement that pledged to protect European companies involved in “legitimate” business dealings with Tehran. In a nod to the tagline of the popular TV series Game of Thrones, Trump tweeted a picture of himself surrounded by fog with the phrase “Sanctions are Coming, November 5.” The sanctions will impact countries that fail to stop importing Iranian oil as well as conduct business dealings with the rogue regime’s financial institutions, banking sector and Iranian officials. The timing of the new sanctions coincides with the anniversary of the 1979 raid on the US embassy in Tehran by Iranian revolutionaries. On Sunday, the regime orchestrated a protest at the site of the former U.S. embassy in downtown Tehran with demonstrators setting U.S. and Israeli flags alight, as well as holding signs reading “Down with USA” and “Down with Israel.”.

U.S. First Lady Melania Trump, left, Russian President Vladimir Putin, center, and U.S. President Donald Trump, pose with a soccer ball after a press conference following their meeting at the Presidential Palace in Helsinki, Finland, Monday, July 16, 2018. (Alexei Nikolsky, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP) (Associated Press) HELSINKI — The Latest on President Donald Trump’s summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin (all times local): 4:20 a.m. President Donald Trump is dismissing suggestions that Russia has compromising intelligence about him after a news conference in which Trump declined to criticize President Vladimir Putin for Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Trump tells Fox News’ Sean Hannity that Putin “said as strongly as you can say it, they have no information on Trump.” Trump adds, “And one thing you know: If they had it, it would have been out.” He says “it’s a shame” that he and Putin had to answer questions about the investigation into Russian election interference. During the news conference in Helsinki Monday, Putin ridiculed allegations that Russian intelligence agencies had collected compromising information on Trump during his visit to Moscow years before the election. Putin called the allegations “sheer nonsense.” __ 2 a.m. Russian President Vladimir Putin says his summit with U.S. President Donald Trump is the beginning of Russia’s path back from Western isolation. Putin spoke to Fox News after his summit Monday with Trump. The Russian leader says the recent U.S. indictment against 12 Russian military officials accused of hacking crimes during the 2016 presidential election is part of an internal political game. He is denying state-sanctioned Russian interference in the election. Putin also denies having compromising information on Trump and says he “was of no interest for us” before he announced his run for presidency, When asked why so many of his critics wind up dead, Putin is blaming troubles with crime in Russia and noting the U.S. has struggled, too, citing John F. Kennedy’s assassination and clashes between police and civilians. __ 10:45 p.m. Facing withering bipartisan criticism over his refusal to publicly acknowledge Russian election meddling during his meeting with President Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump says the two superpowers “must get along.” In a Monday tweet sent as he is flying back to the U.S. aboard Air Force One, Trump says, “As I said today and many times before, ‘I have GREAT confidence in MY intelligence people.’” He adds, “However, I also recognize that in order to build a brighter future, we cannot exclusively focus on the past — as the world’s two largest nuclear powers, we must get along!” Trump met with Putin for three hours Monday before participating in a joint press conference in which Trump did not contest the Russian leader’s election meddling denials. U.S. intelligence agencies have unanimously concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 campaign, most likely to help Trump’s campaign. __ 7:25 p.m. Russian President Vladimir Putin has rejected allegations that Moscow has collected compromising materials on U.S. President Donald Trump or his family. Asked during a joint news conference following their summit in Helsinki, the Russian leader dismissed the claims as “sheer nonsense.” Putin said that he hadn’t been aware of Trump’s visit to Moscow a few years before his 2016 election, which has been stained by accusations that Russians hacked and interfered in the campaign to support Trump. Putin, a former KGB agent, scoffed at the notion that the Russian security services try to gather incriminating materials on businessmen, saying: “Do you really believe that we try to shadow every businessman?” ___ 7:15 p.m. Russian President Vladimir Putin says he wanted Donald Trump to win the U.S. presidency, but strongly denied any Russian state meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. Putin argued that Trump’s calls for better ties during the presidential election campaign “naturally” made him a preferred candidate for many Russians. Asked if he personally favored Trump in the race, Putin responded: “Yes, I wanted him to win because he spoke of normalization of Russian-U.S. ties.” At the same time, Putin rejected the allegations of collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia as “complete nonsense.” The issue is a big concern for many U.S. voters. Putin spoke during a joint news conference with Trump in Helsinki. ___ 7:05 p.m. President Donald Trump says he sees no reason why Russia would interfere in the 2016 election. Trump resisted when asked Monday to condemn Russian meddling in the election. Instead, he complained about a Democratic National Committee computer server and emails belonging to Hillary Clinton, the Democrat he defeated to win the presidency. At a joint appearance in Finland with Vladimir Putin, Trump repeated the Russian leader’s denials about involvement in the election. Trump said of Putin: “He just said it’s not Russia. I will say this: I don’t see any reason why it would be.” Trump commented after holding hours of private talks with Putin. ___ 7 p.m. President Vladimir Putin says that Moscow and Washington could jointly conduct criminal investigations into Russian intelligence officials accused of hacking during the 2016 U.S. election campaign. Asked if Russia could extradite 12 Russian military intelligence officers indicted in the U.S. last week on charges of hacking into the Democratic election campaign, Putin challenged the U.S. to take advantage of a 1999 agreement envisaging mutual legal assistance. He said the agreement would allow U.S. officials to request that Russian authorities interrogate the 12 suspects, adding that U.S. officials could request to be present in such interrogations. Putin noted that Russia would expect the U.S. to return the favor and cooperate in the Russian probe against William Browder, a British investor charged of financial crimes in Russia. Browder was a driving force behind a U.S. law targeting Russian officials over human rights abuses. Putin spoke after a summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Helsinki on Monday. ___ 7 p.m. President Donald Trump says Russian President Vladimir Putin made an “incredible offer” to allow Russian and U.S. investigators to work together on allegations of Russian cyber attacks. Trump says Putin suggested the U.S. provide its intelligence to the Russian military so Russia can determine the truth of what happened. Trump says he has “great confidence” in his intelligence agencies who have concluded Russia interfered in the election. But Trump says Putin was “incredibly strong and powerful today” in his contention that Russia had nothing to do with election interference. The two presidents spoke during a joint news conference following talks in Helsinki. ___ 6:55 p.m. President Donald Trump says the Russia investigation has been a “disaster” for the United States and has kept America and Russia “separated.” Speaking during a joint news conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, he reiterates that there was “no collusion” between his campaign and the Russian government. Trump says he ran a “clean campaign” and he beat his Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton “easily.” The president says it’s a “shame” there is a cloud over his administration. He says he ran a “brilliant campaign and that’s why I’m president.” Putin is pushing back against claims that his government interfered in the U.S. election. He says there’s “no evidence when it comes to the actual facts.” Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

The report - which is not yet public - was summarised for congress by US Attorney General William Barr. Mr Trump tweeted in response: \"No Collusion, No Obstruction\". Claims of Russian collusion have dogged Mr Trump's presidency. He said it was \"a shame the country had to go through this\", describing the inquiry as \"an illegal takedown that failed\". Robert Mueller's investigation has led to some of Mr Trump's aides being prosecuted and, in some cases, imprisoned. The report also considered whether there was obstruction of justice. It \"did not draw a conclusion\", according to Mr Barr's letter. Some of Mr Trump's opponents say there are still questions to answer. Despite that, it is \"without doubt the best day that Donald Trump has had since his inauguration\", says our North America editor Jon Sopel.

Conservative institutions have embraced Bannon's political slaughter not for his past sins but because he criticized the president. That's chilling. Steve Bannon (Photo: Alex Brandon, AP) Steve Bannon — the loathed architect of President Trump’s alt-right hate machine, Breitbart lies, racism, misogyny and Twitter thug troll factory — is banished to political Siberia. It was swift and decisive. Bannon is a deplorable human being who has no business being in a position of power or having the ear of any lawmaker. But as deplorable as he may be, his destruction by Trump and the sycophantic army Bannon helped incubate should frighten every American. Why? Because it’s not why he was taken down and kicked to the curb. The former top campaign strategist, former National Security Council member (appointed by Trump) and former Breitbart News chairman has been given the heave-ho by pretty much the entire Trump establishment. Yet just days ago, he was king and kingmaker, second only to Trump, and viewed by many as Trump’s Svengali. More: Trump team collusion with Russia? Ukraine connection may hold key. More: Michael Wolff book: Bannon's downfall with Trump, Breitbart and the Mercers? At Breitbart, Bannon created an online haven — a fertile safe space — for white nationalists and anti-Semites. Then he mobilized them behind a reality show host/failed casino owner/conspiracy theorist buffoon who won the GOP presidential nomination, largely because his outrageous clown show was ratings gold. Many right-wing media figures, authors and commentators had made their fame and fortune with a Clinton in the White House. They likely wanted a repeat of that success and no doubt believed a Trump nomination ensured a Hillary Clinton win. I’m guessing more than a few publishers have a stale anti-President Hillary book proposal or two gathering dust in a drawer. Bannon openly campaigned to tear down American institutions, the Republican Party and the government. His white nationalism was first ignored, then tolerated and even welcomed by some. When Trump brought him to the White House as a top aide, Bannon's appointment was cheered by leaders of the Ku Klux Klan, the American Nazi Party and other white nationalist groups. Backed by the power of enormous amounts of money from the uber-wealthy Mercers, Bannon and Breitbart were being normalized. They worked to normalize Trump. Such was Bannon’s ability to infiltrate society with his and Trump’s morally reprehensible attitudes, they both vigorously campaigned for Alabama's Senate candidate Roy Moore — who was credibly accused by multiple women of molesting them when they were adolescents and teens. Moore led in the polls for weeks before his defeat. Bannon is now ruined because in a few moments of uncharacteristic truth-telling to Fire and Fury author Michael Wolff, he shared the identical sentiments and concerns as his colleagues and most of his fellow citizens. He described suspicions and assumptions that nearly all of Washington, the press corps, Congress and many Americans share: that Trump knew full well his relatives and staff were meeting in Trump Tower with the Russians to get dirt on Hillary Clinton. Conspiracy and collusion. Let that sink in for a moment. When Bannon promoted white nationalism, misogyny, an accused child molester, severe online bullying and conspiracy theories, he was a king to the right-wing media, Trump and most of the Republicans in Congress. But when he dared to tell the truth, when confirmation from an insider could help save the country from the danger, Bannon was cut out like a member of Tony Soprano’s “family” who turned state’s evidence. It’s one thing for Trump to cut off ties to Bannon. But the wholesale embracing of Bannon’s political slaughter by conservative institutions for this, rather than for his past ugly sins, is quite another. Finally, dropped by the Mercers, and by extension and formally by Breitbart, Bannon is now a man without a country, friends or home. That conveys an ominous message: Do not criticize this American president or you will be destroyed. More: Trump's 'stable genius' reality check: America, this isn't a drill POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media It doesn’t matter who is the target, or that our disgust toward the likes of Bannon is appropriate and well-earned. The swiftness and robot-like precision with which Trump’s allies dislodged their lips from Bannon’s MAGA derriere, so they could effectively reach for their shivs upon orders from Trump, is chilling. Not one White House staffer has publicly questioned whether Bannon’s words rang true. Not one Republican senator has suggested publicly that perhaps we should pay heed to Bannon’s words to Wolff. No one at Breitbart, or the Mercers, or the Republican National Committee or even Bannon’s Gilligan to his Skipper, Corey Lewandowski, seems curious about what Bannon said — and if it’s true, what danger the country may be in. The only concern is to protect and cover for Trump at all costs. Even so, Bannon and others who “know too much” can be dangerous to a president with a few too many secrets. Trump would be wise to heed this advice: Never put anyone in a position where they’ve got nothing left to lose.

McMaster bashed President Trump’s presidential campaign chief executive and former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon on Sunday, accusing him of advancing his own “narrow” agenda. When asked by Fox News’ Chris Wallace if he was trying to say that Bannon was “trying to work around and advance his own agenda,” McMaster responded: “There were some who try to operate outside of that process for their own narrow agendas, and that didn’t serve the president well.” advertisement Breitbart News Senior Editor at Large Joel B. Pollak responded: “Bannon’s only agenda was Trump’s campaign promises on his whiteboard.” Bannon’s only agenda was Trump’s campaign promises on his whiteboard. So far McMaster’s agenda breaks from some of those (especially Israel) https://t.co/gYJM9APzpW — Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) September 17, 2017 Bannon’s West Wing whiteboard became widely known as the only official White House log of Trump’s campaign promises, a daily prompt to make sure that the president stuck to the agenda on which he was elected. That agenda included promises such as avoiding unnecessary wars, implementing a refugee ban, renegotiating trade deals, enacting tax reform for the middle class, and repealing Obamacare. McMaster, arguably, has tried to steer the president away from that populist, nationalist agenda, and towards one he believes serves the country better. For example, McMaster has reportedly urged the president to recertify the Iran deal, and has repeatedly argued against the use of the term “radical Islamic terrorism.” He also opposed Trump’s summit in Saudi Arabia — Iran’s arch enemy — earlier this year, calling it “too ambitious,” as Breitbart News has previously reported. He also was publicly noncommittal on Trump’s efforts to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. McMaster has tried to put other words in the president’s mouth — promising allies at a NATO summit in May that Trump would reaffirm Article Five of the convention. Trump chose not to do so explicitly, in line with his pressure tactic to urge NATO members to meet their defense spending commitments. (Since then, the president has reaffirmed Article Five several times, after members began paying more.) But one of McMaster’s biggest successes is convincing the president to go against his earlier instincts and agree to a nearly 4,000-troop increase in Afghanistan, retrying the same strategy the military wanted to pursue in 2009, but this time without a exit date. He also reportedly presented the president with an option for an increase of 50,000 U.S. troops. Bannon, on the other hand, wanted to draw down U.S. forces to a counterterrorism mission in line with Trump’s promises on the campaign trail to end the war. McMaster has also been accused of pushing out those who were trying to implement the president’s agenda. For example, retired Army Col. Derek Harvey, the former Middle East adviser at the National Security Council, had drafted a plan to withdraw from the Iran deal. McMaster had reportedly told Harvey to stop talking to Bannon, who McMaster knew was close to the president and had his ear, as Breitbart News has previously reported. When Harvey was seen leaving Bannon’s office after that, one of McMaster’s top aides, who had served as a top official under the Obama administration, reportedly told him it was not a good idea to talk to Bannon, and McMaster fired Harvey later that week. In the Fox News interview, McMaster downplayed reports of feuding with Bannon, saying “this really didn’t even happen.” “I think this has been too hyped on one individual. I mean, these reports of feuding, this really didn’t even happen. I mean, we had our doors open to all perspectives within the National Security Council,” he said. “It was up to those individuals whether they would walk through that door and permit — and participate in an open and transparent process,” he added.

{"global_context": "Michael Brown's mother could soon have oversight over the police department connected to her son's death, if voters in Ferguson, Missouri, elect her to the City Council. Lesley McSpadden, 39, is among three candidates running in Ferguson's 3rd Ward on Tuesday. She faces incumbent Keith Kallstrom and Fran Griffin, who has been active on several Ferguson boards. Brown, a black 18-year-old, was fatally shot by white Ferguson officer Darren Wilson on Aug. 9, 2014, touching off months of protests and violence. Wilson claimed he was forced to shoot when the unarmed Brown came at him menacingly after attacking the officer during a street confrontation. A St. Louis County grand jury's November 2014 decision not to indict Wilson sparked renewed unrest. \"I wanted to go back and do something right in a place that did something so very wrong to my son, and I think that's what my son would want as well,\" McSpadden said in an interview with The Associated Press McSpadden, who spelled her first name \"Lezley\" for an autobiography but said she otherwise goes by Lesley, is new at being a candidate but has been at the edge of politics since her son's death. She's been front-and-center in the national Black Lives Matter movement. She endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in early 2016, at a time when Clinton was fending off a primary challenge from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. She was among seven \"Mothers of the Movement\" who appeared on stage at the Democratic National Convention in 2016. Those mothers lost children in police shootings, in police custody or from gun violence. Also in 2016, McSpadden testified in favor of a Missouri Senate bill aimed at increasing use of police body cameras. Police accountability will be a top priority if she's elected, McSpadden said. \"I think they should work much harder to prove that they are there to protect and serve, because no one believed that in August 2014 and people are still skeptical,\" she said. In the aftermath of Brown's death, Ferguson's criminal justice system drew heavy criticism for its treatment of poor and minority residents. Police were accused of singling out blacks for unnecessary traffic stops and harassing them on the street. The municipal court was accused of heaping on fines for minor offenses. While the U.S. Department of Justice also found no grounds to prosecute Wilson, the agency's blistering report of the police and municipal court practices led to a consent agreement requiring reforms that are still being implemented. McSpadden said she wants police to build a stronger relationship with the community and engage with young people, \"not just when something bad happens and you're pressured to do it, but to be that civil servant in the community that you signed up to be.\" Not everyone believes she's ready for a council seat. LaTasha Brown, president of the Southeast Ferguson Neighborhood Association, said she was concerned that McSpadden has largely run for office from afar rather than getting in touch with the community. \"The 3rd Ward needs somebody who's going to mingle with the people,\" Brown said. \"You can't make change from a distance. If you don't know what your constituents are going through, if you're not there to hear what they're saying, how can you lead these people and make decisions for these people?\" Kallstrom was a councilman for 10 years, took seven years off, then won three-year terms in 2013 and 2016. He cited his role in helping Ferguson navigate the ongoing consent agreement with the Justice Department. He wants to increase funding for the Ferguson Police Department \"to get their pay up to where we will quit losing officers to better-paying agencies,\" Kallstrom said. Phone messages seeking comment from Griffin were not immediately returned. McSpadden said she moved to Ferguson a year ago from a neighboring community specifically to run for the council. \"I wanted to come back to a place that caused me so much pain and did me so wrong, and to do something right,\" McSpadden said.

{"global_context": "As it stands now, the Senate’s tax overhaul plan is slightly different from that of the House’s version. Tax reform is now in the Senate’s hands. Republicans only have two votes to spare in the Senate, where they hold a 52-to-48 edge. Vice President Mike Pence would break the tie, if needed. However, multiple Republicans remain uncommitted to the bill, citing concerns with tax breaks for businesses or a potential increase in the federal deficit. As it stands now, the Senate’s tax overhaul plan is slightly different from that of the House’s version. The two chambers would need to come together on a unified piece of legislation to advance to President Trump’s desk. Here’s a look at what the Senate’s tax plan would do. State and local deductions The Senate’s tax plan would eliminate state and local tax deductions – meaning taxpayers in high-tax states would lose a write-off. This would impact mostly blue states, such as California and New York. This is one area where the House and Senate plans have diverged, especially as many House lawmakers – including Republicans – opposed the provision. The House’s measure leaves in place property tax deductions up to $10,000. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, is also concerned about the impact the elimination of these deductions would have on taxpayers. She reportedly met with Trump to discuss a compromise in the final legislation, such as the one provided in the House measure. She said it was a “fair assumption” that she was more likely to support the tax reform measure with the inclusion of the property tax deduction. Pass-through provisions Provisions for “pass-through” businesses is shaping up to be one of the greater fights among lawmakers in the tax reform debate. A pass-through business refers to one that is not a corporation, and therefore isn’t taxed as such. These include sole proprietorships, joint ventures, limited liability companies and S corporations. Millions of American businesses use the pass-through taxation format, where the profits are counted in the owners’ personal tax returns. The Senate measure would set a new deduction of 17.4 percent for those who qualify for the pass-through taxation. It also makes it easier for taxpayers to obtain this deduction. However, it includes a clause that would sunset this deduction after 2025. On the other hand, the House plan would reduce the tax from 39.6 percent to 25 percent. At odds here is which plan provides a greater savings for a greater number of pass-through businesses. As Politico noted, under the Senate’s version, not everyone would be able to take advantage of the full 17.4 deduction offered. If half of a taxpayer’s wages is lower than 17.4 percent, that is the applicable deduction. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., voted to move the legislation out of the Budget Committee Tuesday, but he told Fox News he still has reservations about pass-through deductions. “Right now, the vast majority of pass-throughs will not be able to deduct state and local income taxes, where C Corps [C Corporations] will,” Johnson said. “I don’t see how that is politically sustainable. It’s certainly not fair. It widens with disparity and puts those pass-through businesses at a competitive disadvantage.” Johnson added that Trump said the pass-through issue was “important” and promised to “fix” it. Like Johnson, Sen. Steve Daines of Montana hasn’t put his support behind the Senate’s plan over concerns about pass-through businesses. Individual mandate The Senate’s tax plan includes a repeal of the individual mandate, the ObamaCare requirement for Americans to have health care. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, broke with her party and voted against a skinny repeal of the Obama-era health care earlier this year, but she might be open to passing tax reform with this provision if certain amendments are included. After meeting with Trump Tuesday, Collins said she'd also won agreement that before completing the tax measure, Congress would approve legislation restoring federal payments to health insurers that Trump scuttled last month. The Congressional Budget Office predicted that repealing the mandate could reduce federal deficits by about $338 billion over the next 10 years. It would also increase the number of insured Americans by about 13 million people in that same time span. Corporate tax rate When it comes to reducing the corporate tax rate, the House and the Senate agree. Both chambers want to see the tax rate lowered to 20 percent from 35 percent. SENATE REPUBLICANS CONSIDER TAX BILL FIGHT, EYE LIGHTER TRIM TO CORPORATE TAX RATE However, the Senate measure would delay the implementation for one year. Child tax credit The Senate measure would drastically hike the current per-child tax credit to $2,000 from $1,000. Some Republican senators, including Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah, have advocated for increasing the deduction. Earlier in November, Rubio criticized the House plan for not raising the credit enough. The House plan would only raise it by $600. The progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has criticized the Senate proposal for not helping enough low-income families despite raising the credit. Writers for the think tank argued that many families would be unable to receive the full benefits. Ivanka Trump, the presidential daughter and adviser, has been largely involved in working with lawmakers on boosting the child tax credit. Standard deduction With the Senate bill, the standard deduction – the amount which reduces the amount of income Americans are taxed – would increase to $12,000 for individual filers and $24,000 for married couples. Republicans say that provision would be a net benefit for most tax filers. Tax experts also predict that this provision would drastically decrease the number of taxpayers who would file itemized deductions as some would see a greater savings with this plan. Mortgage deduction The Senate tax reform measure would leave the mortgage deduction pretty much alone, capping it at $1 million. The Senate Finance Committee said this “incentive for homeownership provides tax relief to current and aspiring homeowners.” The House plan, on the other hand, would drastically reduce the cap on the popular deduction to mortgage interest to $500,000. Alternative minimum tax The alternative minimum tax would disappear under both the House and Senate’s plans. The tax is meant to offset benefits a person with a high income could receive. It also ensures taxpayers pay a minimum of tax, according to the Internal Revenue Service. About 5 million households a year are targeted with the alternative minimum tax, NPR reported. Over the years, it has not been adjusted for inflation and has hit more households than originally intended, tax experts have said. Estate tax Republicans hope to phase out the so-called estate tax – sometimes referred to as the “death tax” by opponents – with their tax overhaul. The federal estate tax is a tax on the transfer of property after someone’s death. That property must exceed a certain value amount for the tax to be applicable. Only the wealthiest 0.2 percent of estates owed any estate tax at last count, according to IRS data and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The Senate’s plan does not eliminate the tax, but it would double the exemption. On the other hand, the House version would double the exemption to $11 million for individuals and $22 million for couples, but would repeal the entire tax after 2023. Medical expense deductions While the House plan would eliminate the medical expense deductions, the Senate measure would leave it in place. Under the current system, taxpayers are able to deduct medical expenses that exceed 10 percent of a person’s adjusted gross income. That percentage is lowered to 7.5 percent for taxpayers who are over 65 years old. AARP, the seniors' lobbying group, has urged Congress to keep the deduction in place. \"For people who are sick, many of whom are going to be older Americans, this medical expense deduction makes their health care more affordable,\" said Cristina Martin Firvida, AARP's lead lobbyist on financial security issues. \"To them, it is a very big deal.\" Tax brackets The Senate proposal keeps the current number of personal income tax brackets, seven, though it changes the rates to 10, 12, 22, 24, 32, 35 and 38.5 percent. That last top bracket for the wealthiest earners carries a higher rate of 39.6 percent under current law. The House bill goes further toward simplifying the tax system. It shrinks the number of brackets from seven to four, with rates of 12, 25, 35 and 39.6 percent. Fox News' Chad Pergram and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

By Thomas Kennedy When Donald Trump decided in September to end the DACA, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program that protected young undocumented immigrants from deportation, he put the lives of 800,000 Dreamers in turmoil. The media reported at the time that like other consequential actions he’s taken, Trump did not fully understand the consequences of the decision he made. The irresponsibility of this action cannot be overstated. The Dreamers trusted the federal government with vital personal information, such as fingerprints and addresses. They knew full well that their status under DACA would be temporary and that they would have to renew it every two years, but they accepted assurances from the government that their information would not be used against them. These Dreamers have lived in the United States for most of their lives. They have bought cars, taken out mortgages on houses, paid tuition for higher education, started businesses, and began their careers in this country that they call home. To many of them, English is the only language that they can comfortably speak and write. Unfortunately, due to Trump’s reckless decision to use these young people as bargaining chips in Congress, many of them are currently losing their legal status or are at risk of doing so in the upcoming months. The inhumanity and sheer cruelty of the situation easily warrants it as one of the worst actions undertaken by an administration already plagued by disastrous decisions. Trump has given Congress six months to act and address the crisis. Finding a solution for young undocumented immigrants is a bi-partisan effort with support from people on both sides of the aisle. Unfortunately Congressional leaders, such as the House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader are reluctant to address the issue. Despite polling that shows more than three-fourths of Republicans support letting Dreamers stay in the United States and a letter signed by dozens of House Republicans calling on the party’s leaders to bring legislation to a vote, they have not moved on it. I grew up undocumented in this country, so I know the fear of living everyday knowing that any random mistake can result in possible deportation. I remember how elated I was when the original Dream Act was introduced in 2010 to provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and how disappointed I felt when it did not pass. Although I was able to resolve my status since then and become a U.S. citizen, there are hundreds of thousands of others who have not had the same opportunity and who are now living with uncertainty every day. In my hometown of Miami, 15 Dreamers and allies, including myself, have been fasting for a week to call attention to this urgent issue. In solidarity with massive mobilizations that happened this week on the steps of the U.S. Capitol in D.C., these immigrant youths are putting their bodies on the line to call on Florida Senator Marco Rubio and Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart to exhibit bold and brave leadership. We need them to follow in the footsteps of fellow Republican legislators, such as Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Carlos Curbelo, and support legislation that would protect both the Dreamers and TPS holders, as well as commit to not vote on any spending bill until these immigrants have obtained legal permanent residence. “This fasting symbolizes that the hunger that we have to stay in this country is more important than eating and we are willing to put our bodies on the line for it. I feel happy to be part of a group of courageous individuals that is working for a clean Dream Act and obtaining a permanent solution for TPS holders, both of which would protect millions of individuals” said Monica Larazo, one of the Dreamers who went on the hunger strike this week. Undocumented immigrants in this country have for too long been used as a political football in Congress. It’s time for Congress to listen to the American people and work to ensure that the immigrant community is protected. We need a Dream Act now that allows hard working immigrants who are our neighbors, friends, family and colleagues, remain a permanent fabric in our communities.

{"global_context": "The charges against 13 Russians have injected a new twist into a debate that has consumed the political universe since the final hours of election night: How did Trump do it?. The dispute is especially raw because of the razor-thin margin in the election and the uncertainty over what exactly tipped the balance. Mrs. Clinton, who handily won the national popular vote, lost the Electoral College vote and therefore the presidency because Mr. Trump defeated her by less than a combined 80,000 votes in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Few Democrats believe that Mr. Trump won solely as a result of Russia’s intervention. But many think the meddling exacerbated Mrs. Clinton’s challenges, making her more vulnerable to what some believe was the decisive blow: the announcement by James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director at the time, just over a week before the election that he was reopening the investigation into her use of a private email server. “Russia succeeded in weakening her enough so that the Comey letter could knock her off,” said Jennifer Palmieri, who was Mrs. Clinton’s campaign communications director. But veterans of Mr. Trump’s campaign shake their head at what they believe is an abiding sense of denial among Clinton loyalists over her deficiencies. “The election was still won because Donald Trump was a better candidate with a superior message taking on a horrible candidate who people thought was corrupt,” said David Bossie, a senior Trump strategist who is now president of the conservative lobbying group Citizens United. He allowed that Moscow had mounted a “malicious, disruptive campaign.” No single factor was determinative in an election that brought nearly 140 million Americans to the polls. And the nation’s intelligence agencies say they do not have any way to calculate whether the Russian effort swung the election. “To credit the victory to anyone else including those 13 Russians is to demean everyday Americans’ power to control their own destiny,” said Stephen K. Bannon, the Trump campaign chief executive, who reportedly spent 20 hours with the team led by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel in the Russia investigation, last week. “The ‘deplorables’ deserve better.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Yet it is difficult for Republicans to contend that the multimillion-dollar Russian intervention had no impact, with 126 million Americans being exposed to Russian-sponsored posts on Facebook alone. The interference was not limited to the actions laid out by Mr. Mueller in the indictment of the 13 Russians linked to a “troll farm” known as the Internet Research Agency. According to the intelligence community, the Russian government supported the email hacking of the Democratic National Committee and the personal account of John D. Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman, as well as the disclosure of Mrs. Clinton’s paid speeches. The committee emails, leaked just before the Democratic National Convention, helped increase the rancor between supporters of Mrs. Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders. Photo And the Podesta emails, leaked slowly over the month of October, were doled out selectively, with a number of exchanges held back, according to two Clinton campaign officials. While there were plenty of anodyne messages in the trove, the hackers made sure to reveal the messages that maximized the appearance of D.N.C. behavior unfairly favoring Mrs. Clinton’s campaign. Further, a major factor in Mrs. Clinton’s loss of the three crucial Rust Belt states, which every Democratic nominee had carried since 1992, was a drop-off in turnout and the performance of third-party candidates. She could not match former President Barack Obama’s turnout among blacks in cities like Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee, and the Green Party nominee, Jill Stein, captured enough votes to make up the difference between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.

It says that they funded social media posts that were explicitly aimed at encouraging “U.S. minority groups not to vote in the 2016 U.S. presidential election or to vote for a third-party U.S. presidential candidate.” For example, the Russians created an Instagram account, “Woke Blacks,” and posted messages urging African-Americans not to vote at all rather than support “the lesser of two devils.” They also purchased an ad on Instagram to promote a post that read: “Choose peace and vote for Jill Stein. Trust me, it’s not a wasted vote.” “The Stein vote alone clearly diminished Clinton’s vote and some of the vote that might have gone to us in Milwaukee and stayed home was probably discouraged, and this Russia stuff played a role in that discouragement,” said Paul Maslin, a Democratic pollster based in Wisconsin. “Out of the 10 factors that most caused Trump to win, maybe this was only the seventh, but the fact that this is even on a relatively short list ought to be alarming.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Still, Republicans and even some Democrats note that the Russian meddling may not have mattered at all if Mrs. Clinton had run a better campaign. She ventured twice to Ohio in the final days of the campaign — a state she would lose by eight points — but never set foot in Wisconsin during the general election, and she made a few strategic errors in Michigan. Despite pleas from Michigan officials, her national campaign did not ask Mr. Obama to visit the state until the last day of the campaign — and it was forced to dispatch him to Ann Arbor to rally college students rather than sending him to Detroit, because a police funeral was scheduled in the city. And when Mrs. Clinton visited Michigan in the last days of the election, she spent some of her time in the deeply conservative and religious western part of the state trying to win over Republicans who were thought to be uneasy with Mr. Trump on moral grounds. “It’s complicated,” said Representative Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who pleaded with Mrs. Clinton’s campaign to devote more attention to the state. “The Russians clearly did things that made their way into Michigan. At the same time, as Democrats, if we’re not talking about issues that matter to people, then we’re not connecting with our base either.” Stu Sandler, a Michigan Republican strategist, was blunter: “Clinton didn’t do enough in inner-city Detroit, and that was noticed by a lot of Democrats here.” Mrs. Clinton did spend considerable time in Pennsylvania, but she suffered there from what plagued her in the other parts of the industrial Midwest: Too many black voters stayed home, a slice of white liberals voted third-party, and many of the working-class whites who had backed Mr. Obama swung to Mr. Trump. Her environmental and gun-control policies turned off some of the state’s ancestral Democrats, and the views she and her husband held in the 1990s on criminal justice depressed black turnout. “She was very unpopular here, so she didn’t motivate the Democrats,” said Rob Gleason, who was the state Republican chairman in 2016. Advertisement Continue reading the main story To Democrats, though, Mrs. Clinton’s shortcomings were precisely what Russia preyed on to undercut her campaign. “We will never be able to know for certain if the massive Russian operation was the difference between victory and defeat,” said Representative Brendan F. Boyle of Pennsylvania. “But there is one thing we absolutely can say with certainty: It was a factor. The Russians wouldn’t have devoted hundreds of people and tens of millions of dollars on this operation if it wasn’t having an effect.” Even as Mr. Trump polarizes the country, both his admirers and detractors found themselves in agreement with one of his many Twitter observations on Sunday: that the Russians intended to sow chaos, and “have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams.”.

President Donald Trump took a prime-time victory lap on Monday night following the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, proudly proclaiming that the man had been “proven innocent” after a “campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception.” “On behalf of our nation, I would like to apologize to Brett and his family for the terrible pain and suffering that you have been forced to endure,” Trump, standing in the East Room of the White House, said in the televised event. “Those who step forward to serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation.” The event was the third swearing-in ceremony for the nominee after a historically contentious confirmation battle following several allegations against the judge. Christine Blasey Ford’s bombshell interview with The Washington Post and her emotional testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee threatened to upend the nomination after she accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were both in high school. The nomination went forward, and Kavanaugh was confirmed in a slim 50-48 vote on Saturday. Trump chastised the bitter process during his opening remarks Monday as every sitting member of the Supreme Court and several Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), looked on. He once again cast doubt on the women’s claims, calling them “lies,” following up on assertions he made earlier in the day when he told reporters at the White House that Kavanaugh was “caught up in a hoax that was set up by the Democrats.” “What happened to the Kavanaugh family violates every notion of fairness, decency and due process,” the president said in his remarks at the swearing in. “In our country, a man or a woman must always be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.” Trump continued: “And with that I must state that you, sir, under historic scrutiny, were proven innocent.” Kavanaugh himself sought to recast himself as an impartial, evenhanded judge devoted to the rule of law in his own remarks, a departure from his fiery testimony before lawmakers last week. “The Senate confirmation process was contentious and emotional,” he said. “That process is over. My focus now is to be the best justice I can be. I take this office with gratitude and no bitterness. My goal is to be a great justice for all Americans.” Kavanaugh also singled out several lawmakers for their work, including Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), whose last-minute support and blistering 45-minute speech on the Senate floor all but secured his confirmation. Despite the heated fight, the judge moved to distance himself from political divisions and said he planned to work with his new colleagues to be an “umpire, a neutral and impartial decider who favors no side.”.

{"global_context": "The term-limited governor was widely expected to announce a run against incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson (D). Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) will run for U.S. Senate, hoping to unseat three-term incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson (D) in what could become one of the most contentious and expensive Senate races this year. The term-limited governor confirmed widespread speculation that he was planning to run in an interview with Politico published Monday morning. “You’re probably surprised, but I’m going to announce I’m running for senator,” he said. “You’re shocked, right?” Scott, a businessman and health care executive before he entered politics in 2010, has already raised more than a million dollars through his super PAC and met with GOP donors last month. President Donald Trump has frequently urged Scott to run. Democrats, who hope to make November’s midterm elections a referendum on Trump, will undoubtedly tie the president to Scott, one of his major allies. But Scott, who has recently broken with the Trump administration on a few issues, dismissed the idea that he was “a Donald Trump Republican.” Scott recently opposed the Interior Department’s plan to dramatically expand offshore oil drilling and Trump’s call for training certain teachers to carry guns to help prevent mass shootings. “If it’s good for us, I’m going to support what the White House wants to do,” he said Monday. “If it’s not good for Florida, I’m going to oppose. I’m not going to be a rubber stamp for anybody.” Joe Raedle via Getty Images Scott has frequently reversed his positions on top issues like offshore drilling and Medicaid expansion. Last month, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee started running digital ads accusing him of “looking out for himself, not doing what’s best for Floridians.” Last week, the DSCC launched a website called SelfServingScott.com. Scott, 65, narrowly edged out Nelson, 75, in a prospective poll conducted by Clearview Research last month, CBS Miami reported. A poll of likely voters gave Scott 43.3 percent of support, two percentage points ahead of the incumbent. “While it is still very early to make any predictions, it is clear that this off-year election could come down to two simple factors: turnout and gaining margins among NPA (no party affiliation) voters,” Steve Vancore, president of Clearview Research, told CBS Miami. The governor’s announcement comes amid the turbulent aftermath of the Feb. 14 school shooting in Parkland, Florida. Scott has endured an onslaught of criticism as teenage survivors advocate for public officials to cut ties with the National Rifle Association. Scott’s past career in health care has haunted him in previous campaigns. From 1987 to 1997, he helmed Columbia/HCA, making it one of the country’s largest health care companies. He also was at the center of one of the biggest Medicare fraud cases in the U.S. Under Scott’s tenure, Columbia billed Medicare and Medicaid for tests that had not been ordered and falsely coded patient records to increase hospital reimbursements. A federal investigation went public in 1997 and Scott resigned four months later, according to Politifact. Scott is expected to make his official announcement in Orlando at 10 a.m. Monday.

Brexiteers have mocked sensational Civil Service leaks claiming Brexit could lead to an almost immediate collapse in essential supplies of food, fuel, and medicine, dubbed the “Armageddon” scenario. The “Doomsday Brexit scenario” was reportedly drawn up by senior civil servants for Brexit Secretary David Davis, and leaked to The Sunday Times, with unnamed sources saying the port of Dover would collapse “on day one” of Brexit. They have drawn up several scenarios for a rapid, ‘No Deal’ Brexit, including a mild one, a severe one, and one ominously dubbed “Armageddon”. “In the second scenario, not even the worst, the port of Dover will collapse on day one.

The supposedly neutral Civil Service has been heavily criticized for effectively campaigning against Brexit, particularly by promoting so-called ‘Project Fear; and now disproven claims the Britain would suffer half a million job losses and be thrust into recession if the people voted to leave the European Union (EU).

The EU has been unwilling to negotiate a mutually beneficial free trade deal in goods and services, so the UK should walk away, so we can enjoy the prosperity and freedom which we deserve.” Leading backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg MP was also dismissive of the ‘Armageddon’ claims. “We would be free to import food, medicines and fuel as we wished and the EU could only stop this if it were to impose sanctions, which is not a credible thought,” he explained. “Except in limited fields, there is no legal mechanism to obstruct trade. The Whitehall document is Project Fear on speed.” “Once again we’re seeing defeatist doom-mongers saying we can’t really leave the EU,” agreed Charlie Elphicke MP, who represents the Port of Dover which will supposedly “collapse” if there is no deal. “[If] we make the investment that’s needed and focus our efforts on ensuring we are ready on day one for Brexit at the Dover front line, we can continue to trade seamlessly — just as we do now with the rest of the world,” he said.

A White House statement said Trump and South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in still underscored the importance of continuing the “maximum pressure” campaign against North Korea over its development of nuclear weapons — the U.S.-led barrage of international sanctions that is starting to bite the North’s meager economy. But South Korea’s presidential office also said Trump told Moon to let North Korea understand that there will be no military action of any kind while the two Koreas continue to hold dialogue, the Yonhap news agency reported. On Tuesday, the two Koreas held their first talks in two years and agreed on the North’s participation in the Winter Olympics being held the South next month. The prospects of resolving decades-old tensions on the divided Korean Peninsula remain deeply uncertain. North Korea has shown no willingness to discuss its nuclear weapons which pose an emerging threat to the American mainland, and it has stuck to its tough stance toward Washington while it tries to woo the South. The newspaper of the ruling party on Tuesday called Trump a “lunatic” and said the U.S. needs to accept North Korea is now a nuclear power. But the thaw between North and South, which have also restored a military hotline, provides a diplomatic opening after months of escalating tensions that have fueled fears of war. “President Trump expressed his openness to holding talks between the United States and North Korea at the appropriate time, under the right circumstances,” the White House statement said. Trump also told Moon that Vice President Mike Pence and his wife Karen Pence will lead the U.S. delegation to the Winter Olympics, scheduled for Feb. 9-25 in Pyeongchang. Pence will stop in Alaska to review intercontinental ballistic missile defense systems and in Japan, stressing the U.S. commitment to stability in the region. Speaking at Cabinet meeting Wednesday, Trump claimed his administration’s pressure campaign had prompted the North Koreans to negotiate with the South, and he voiced cautious hopes for diplomatic success. “Without our attitude that would have never happened,” Trump said of the inter-Korean dialogue. “Who knows where it leads. Hopefully it will lead to success for the world — not just for our country but for the world, and we’ll be seeing over the next number of weeks and months what happens.” Moon has been supportive of the pressure campaign but has long advocated engagement with Pyongyang. He told reporters in Seoul Wednesday that he’s open to meeting with Kim to resolve the North Korean nuclear standoff, although he said the success of such a summit must be guaranteed before the meeting can be realized. Trump has previously scoffed at the futility of talking with the North, but when the inter-Korean dialogue was proposed last week he claimed credit and declared in a tweet, “talks are a good thing.” The White House said Moon had briefed Trump on the outcomes of the North-South talks on Tuesday, and “thanked President Trump for his influential leadership in making the talks possible.” Yonhap cited Moon’s chief press secretary, Yoon Young-chan, as saying Trump dismissed a recent report that he may be considering military action against the North. The White House statement did not mention that, nor Trump’s assurance that military force would not happen while the two Koreas continue to talk. The U.S. retains 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War that ended with an armistice rather than a peace treaty, leaving the adversaries in a state of war for the past six decades. The prospect of military confrontation has been magnified in the past year as Trump and Kim have traded bellicose rhetoric and crude insults, as the North has conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear detonation and three tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles that now put the U.S. mainland in North Korea’s range. Resorting to force is widely viewed as very risky. A pre-emptive U.S. attack could provoke a devastating retaliation by North Korea against the South, whose capital Seoul lies with the range of North Korean artillery and rockets.

{"global_context": "Paul Manafort, a former campaign manager for President Donald Trump, surrendered to the FBI on Monday and another ex-aide pleaded guilty to lying to agents in the most serious steps yet of a federal probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Paul Manafort, a former campaign manager for President Donald Trump, surrendered to the FBI on Monday and another ex-aide pleaded guilty to lying to agents in the most serious steps yet of a federal probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Manafort, 68, a longtime Republican operative, arrived at the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Washington field office to hand himself in after being indicted by a federal grand jury on charges including money laundering, which carries a maximum 20-year prison sentence. Neither Trump nor his campaign were mentioned in the indictment and many of the charges, some of which go back more than a decade, have to do with Manafort’s work for Ukraine’s pro-Russian government and political figures there. But in a separate development directly related to Trump’s 2016 election campaign, it emerged on Monday that a former campaign aide George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty earlier this month to making false statements to FBI agents. The office of Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller said Papadopoulos had told FBI agents he had been in contact with a professor in London who claimed to have information that would hurt Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in the form of “thousands of emails.” Papadopolous initially said such contacts occurred before he joined Trump’s campaign but in fact he did not meet the professor until after he joined the campaign, the counsel’s office said. Investigations by Mueller and several congressional panels into alleged Russian efforts to tilt the election in Trump’s favor and potential collusion by Trump aides have cast a shadow over the Republican president’s first nine months in office, and have widened the rift between Republicans and Democrats. Manafort ran the Trump campaign from June to August of 2016 before resigning amid reports he might have received millions in illegal payments from a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine. Manafort associate Rick Gates was also named in the 12-count indictment, the first since Mueller was appointed special counsel in May. Lawyers for Gates and Manafort did not immediately return calls for comment. An initial court appearance and arraignment for the two men was scheduled for 1:30 p.m. (1730 GMT) on Monday in Washington. Trump, who has denied any allegations of collusion with the Russians, reiterated that denial on Monday, as well as his public frustration with the Mueller probe, which he has called “a witch hunt.” “Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren’t Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????,” Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to Clinton. Federal agents arrive with former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort (back seat) in custody on charges related to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, at the federal courthouse in Washington, U.S., October 30, 2017. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst “It has nothing to do with the campaign or the allegations of collusion with Russia,” said Washington attorney John Dowd, who represents Trump in the Russia probe, of the indictment. Legal experts said the indictment could just be an opening salvo by Mueller. It put pressure on Manafort to cooperate with Mueller’s Russia investigation, said Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago. “If I were the defense lawyer I’d be looking into cooperating,” he said. U.S. intelligence agencies say Russia interfered in the election, by hacking and releasing embarrassing emails and disseminating propaganda via social media to discredit Clinton. The Kremlin has denied any meddling. ‘LAVISH LIFESTYLE’ Slideshow (2 Images) The indictment contains counts of conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, acting as unregistered agents of Ukraine’s government, false and misleading statements and failure to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts, the special counsel said. Mueller has been investigating Manafort’s financial and real estate dealings and his prior work for a political group, the Party of Regions, which backed former pro-Kremlin Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich. Both Manafort and Gates generated tens of millions of dollars of income from Ukraine work and laundered money through scores of U.S. and foreign entities to hide payments from U.S. authorities, the indictment said. They concealed from the United States their work and revenue as agents of Ukrainian political parties and used their wealth to lead a “lavish lifestyle” without paying taxes on the income, it says. Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer called for the Trump administration to avoid interfering with Mueller’s probe. “The rule of law is paramount in America and the investigation must be allowed to proceed unimpeded. The president must not, under any circumstances, interfere with the special counsel’s work in any way,” Schumer said. Gates was a longtime business partner of Manafort and has ties to many of the same Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs. He also served as deputy to Manafort during his brief tenure as Trump’s campaign chairman. Manafort was indicted on nine counts and Gates was indicted on eight counts.

{"global_context": "The Democratic primary has been far steadier than many people realize. In recent cycles, the debates have been enough to bring more attention to some candidates and put them into contention. That was the case in 2012, for instance, for Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich. A few candidates, like Rick Perry or Scott Walker, stumbled in the debates and never recovered. But more often, the debates have a far more modest effect, and it is important to have some perspective. A shift in support is likely to be fleeting, not a lasting change in the race. You might feel that many candidates this cycle have already faltered, even if not as dramatically as Mr. Perry did with his “oops” moment. Beto O’Rourke or Kamala Harris, for instance, enjoyed initial success but have slipped back in the polls. But sometimes even those who fall into a steep decline can recover, like John McCain in 2008. Mr. O’Rourke and Ms. Harris still possess the traits that made them intriguing to Democrats, and could easily claw back, for example. Elizabeth Warren has already done something like what Ms. Harris and Mr. O’Rourke might hope to do. She struggled early on, in part because of questions about her electability and the way she handled a DNA test on her claim to Native American heritage. But she has since recovered, and more, going on to deliver a steady stream of policy proposals. If Ms. Warren winds up advancing to the nomination, perhaps we’ll remember it the way we remember Donald J. Trump’s rise in 2016 or Barack Obama’s in 2008. But for now, she is at just about 12 percent in an average of national polls — about the same support she had shortly after her announcement, a few points behind Bernie Sanders today and a few points higher than Mr. Buttigieg or Mr. O’Rourke at their peaks. Her level of support is less than what Mr. Walker had heading into the first Republican debate; he was out of the race less than two months later. She and other leading candidates may have the spotlight now, but a lesser-known candidate could succeed in prying it away from them in the debates this week, joining Mr. Buttigieg in becoming a more familiar face to Americans.

{"global_context": "\"Clapper has now admitted that there was Spying in my campaign. Large dollars were paid to the Spy, far beyond normal. Starting to look like one of the biggest political scandals in U.S. history. SPYGATE - a terrible thing!\" - President Donald Trump in a tweet, May 24, 2018 President Trump, in a continuing effort to discredit the criminal investigation into his campaign's possible links with Russia entities, has now seized on \"spygate.\" This refers to the news that the FBI obtained information from an informant - Stefan Halper, an emeritus professor at the University of Cambridge - who met with at least three members of Trump's campaign staff suspected of having links to Russia. As an informant, Halper openly asked questions; a spy uses tradecraft to obtain information. So far, there has been nothing to indicate that there was a \"spy\" mandate as part of Halper's assistance for the FBI, which apparently started after the agency opened a counterintelligence probe. Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., a member of the Intelligence Committee who was briefed on the operation, says the FBI acted properly and \"it has nothing to do with Donald Trump.\" But that has not stopped Trump from trying to fan the flames with often inaccurate information. Regarding the tweet above, Trump claims that former director of national intelligence James Clapper Jr. admitted to the campaign spying, when, in fact, Clapper said the opposite. Asked whether the FBI spied on the campaign, Clapper told \"The View\" on May 22: \"No, they were not. They were spying on, a term I don't particularly like, but on what the Russians were doing. Trying to understand, were the Russians infiltrating, trying to gain access, trying to gain leverage or influence, which is what they do.\" While Trump claims \"large dollars\" were paid to Halper, it's unclear what he received for his help on the counterintelligence probe. Halper was paid a little more than $1 million for separate work for the Defense Department's Office of Net Assessment between 2012 and 2017 - and about 40 percent of the money was paid before Trump entered the presidential race. But no dollar figures for his assistance in the Russia probe have been reported. This latest claim, clearly worthy of Four Pinocchios, is just part of a fog machine that the president has deployed for months against the probe, using hyperbolic claims of \"worse than Watergate,\" \"McCarthyism\" and, of course, \"witch hunt.\" Most have failed to gain long-term traction, and \"spygate\" may face the same fate. Democratic leaders, after a closed-door briefing from the FBI on the informant, said they were shown no evidence that supported Trump's claim of spying. Here is a guide to the various \"scandals\" about the probe that Trump has promoted since he became president - and what happened to them. March 4, 2017: 'Obama had my wires tapped at the Trump Tower' The New York Times had reported on Jan. 20, 2017, that investigators were examining intercepted communications and financial transactions as part of the probe into possible links between Russian officials and associates of Trump. In print, the headline was \"Wiretapped Data Used in Inquiry of Trump Aides.\" Then, on March 4, after sketchy reports circulated that purported to expand on the surveillance, Trump tweeted allegations: \"Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!\" He provided no evidence for these assertions, though he told Tucker Carlson on March 15: \"We will be submitting things before the committee very soon that has not been submitted as of yet.\" Nothing was ever submitted. On Sept. 1, the Justice Department said in a court filing that the FBI and the National Security Division confirmed that they had no record that would support Trump's tweets: \"Both FBI and NSD confirm that they have no records related to wiretaps as described by the March 4, 2017 tweets. FBI again confirmed that they do not have any such records by consulting with personnel knowledgeable about Director [James B.] Comey's statements and the surveillance activities of the FBI.\" June 1: 'The big story is the unmasking' Trump began to tout an argument being made by one of his chief defenders, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee - the so-called unmasking of U.S. citizens who were incidentally picked up in surveillance of foreign targets that was a potential Obama-era scandal. \"The intelligence community incidentally collected information about U.S. citizens involved in the Trump transition,\" Nunes told reporters March 23. Trump openly mused that Susan Rice, who was once President Barack Obama's national security adviser, was in big trouble and may have committed a crime. \"I think it's truly one of the big stories of our time,\" he told the New York Times on April 5. But the story did not have legs and faded from sight. Numerous former national security officials told The Fact Checker that Rice, as national security adviser, had every right to request the identities of U.S. citizens who were incidentally recorded or referenced in surveillance conducted by the National Security Agency. It turned out that Rice had unmasked the identities of senior Trump officials to understand why the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates was in New York. Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan had arrived for meetings with Trump aides, but the UAE did not provide the customary notice about his trip to the Obama administration. Republicans on the committee decided she did nothing illegal.

{"global_context": "Boston City Councilwoman Ayanna Pressley made history on several levels Tuesday by easily defeating 10-term Rep. Mike Capuano in the Democratic primary for the U.S. House seat once held by John F. Kennedy and Tip O’Neill. Boston City Councilwoman Ayanna Pressley made history on several levels Tuesday by easily defeating 10-term Rep. Mike Capuano in the Democratic primary for the U.S. House seat once held by John F. Kennedy and Tip O’Neill. Her upset victory shook Massachusetts’ liberal political establishment to its core. Since she faces no Republican opposition in the Nov. 6 midterm election, Pressley is assured of becoming Massachusetts’ first African-American woman in Congress. Capuano, who is white, was endorsed by key labor unions and the Congressional Black Caucus. Prominent African-American Democrats endorsing him included U.S. Rep. and civil right icon John Lewis of Georgia, U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters of California, and former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick. In addition, Boston Mayor Martin Walsh supported Capuano. The congressman’s supporters touted his experience and his clout on the Financial Services Committee. But primary electorates in districts where whites are now in the minority – including Capuano’s – aren’t impressed with such arguments. Pressley attracted supporters with her message that the district needs an activist progressive who will take the lead on social change. Capuano could feel the ground shifting under him. He was criticized for having called former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s kneeling protests against perceived racial injustice and police misconduct “not productive.” Capuano’s warnings that the Democratic Party should avoid being “balkanized” by racial identity were ignored. His support for reforming the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency was ridiculed by Pressley, who called for abolishing ICE. Pressley’s message was simple: “The people closest to the pain should be closest to the power.” She showcased her history as a survivor of sexual assault and her upbringing by a single mother in a household where her father was often in jail. Pressley’s victory, coming on the heels of democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s stunning primary upset in a congressional district in New York City in June, has given the Democratic Party’s hard-left wing the belief that history is on its side. But Tuesday’s primary brought some sobering news as well. Two far-left female challengers to other Massachusetts Democrats were defeated after taking less than 30 percent of the vote against congressional incumbents. Centrist Rep. Richard Neal defeated Tahirah Amatul-Wadud, an African-American Muslim and civil rights lawyer. Rep. Stephen Lynch, a relatively conservative Democrat, won over Brianna Wu, a video game developer. The common thread in both races where the hard-left candidates failed is that while they were all outspent, their constituencies were also primarily both middle-class and non-minority. The far-left forces in the Democratic Party can take satisfaction from their primary victories this year. Last week, leftist Andrew Gillum was able to take advantage of a divided field of moderates and win the Democratic primary for governor in Florida with 34 percent of the vote. Earlier, left-wing African-American candidates Stacey Abrams won the Democratic primary to run for governor of Georgia and Ben Jealous won the Democratic nomination for governor of Maryland. But with rare exceptions, Democrats on the left wing of the party haven’t been able to break out of progressive bubbles and win victories with broader-based constituencies. On the Republican side in the Massachusetts primary, Gov. Charlie Baker was nominated to run for a second term. He will face Democrat Jay Gonzalez in November. GOP state legislator Geoff Diehl was nominated to run for the U.S. Senate against incumbent Democrat Elizabeth Warren, who is heavily favored to win re-election. Diehl, who chaired President Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts, defeated two other Republicans in the primary.

President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in June. (Evan Vucci / Associated Press) Whatever you think of President Trump, you have to admit that he’s an astute reader of politics. So he was right when he told Bloomberg News reporters Thursday that, although he was insisting on total capitulation from Canada in the negotiations over a new North American Free Trade Agreement, he couldn’t say so publicly. Doing so would be “so insulting” to the Canadians, Trump reportedly said, “they’re not going to be able to make a deal.” Unfortunately for Trump, those remarks — which were supposed to be kept off the record — showed up Friday in one of Canada’s largest newspapers, the Toronto Star. Which splashed them across the top of its website under the headline, “Bombshell leak to Toronto Star upends NAFTA talks: In secret ‘so insulting’ remarks, Trump says he isn’t compromising at all with Canada.” We should not be surprised, then, that negotiators for the United States and Canada were unable to reach a deal on NAFTA by Trump’s self-imposed deadline of Friday. For now at least, Canada appears to be, umm, not totally capitulating. Although negotiations will continue, it’s not clear whether there will be a new deal signed by the end of the year, or whether NAFTA will be replaced with just a bilateral agreement between the United States and Mexico.

And people remember that,” Waynesburg resident Larry Douglas said Tuesday. Saccone, a four-term state representative and a military veteran, has held campaign events in Waynesburg, about 26 miles north of West Virginia, at least twice in the past six days. Trump won the state’s 18th Congressional District, where Saccone and Lamb are competing, by nearly 20 points, despite it having more registered Democrats than Republicans. Trump won the district largely on a promise to restart shuttered steel plants and coal mines that appealed to its white, blue-collar workers. And his recent tax cuts and new tariffs on cheap, imported steel and aluminum should help solidify the district’s GOP-leaning voters. Still, at least some registered Democrats in the district’s coal country who voted for Trump could already be looking for the next promise, as wages and job prospects remain relatively unchanged compared with elsewhere in the country, Douglas also said. “People are look for a change and (Lamb) might just able to do that,” he said Tuesday on a Waynesburg sidewalk, just blocks from a shuttered coal mine. Douglas also argued that other southwestern Pennsylvania towns have recently prospered while Waynesburg has not and that nearby Morgantown, W.Va., has roughly 450 practicing lawyers. Lamb has indeed tried to win back district votes with an infrastructure plan that has become a centerpiece of his campaign. Saccone spokesman Patrick McCann told Fox News that the campaign, in the final days, is largely focused on getting voters to the polls and that its closing argument is “record versus rhetoric” -- an attack on Lamb being a first-time candidate and his vow, if elected, not to be a rubber stamp for top House Democrat Nancy Pelosi of California. “State Representative Saccone has consistently delivered for the people of southwestern Pennsylvania and would continue to do so in Congress,” McCann said, amid concerns about whether his candidate’s campaign has an adequate get-out-the-vote operation. Saccone has, in fact, been forced to outsource that operation to paid contractors and the national GOP, which has scrambled to pick up the slack. McCann also played down the argument that the special House election is another test case -- like several last year -- for whether voters will still support the Trump agenda when roughly 470 House and Senate seats are up for re-election in November. “There’s a lot of national attention on the race right now because it’s sort of the only game in town,” he also said. “But each contest, each district is its own animal.” Lamb and Saccone, 60, are competing for the seat left open by GOP Rep. Tim Murphy, who held it for eight terms before resigning in October. Murphy stepped down following news reports he suggested that a woman with whom he was having an extramarital affair get an abortion. Democrats will need to win a total of 24 seats this year to take control of the House. Beyond Saccone’s professional canvassers, teams from the Koch brothers-backed Americans For Prosperity arrived in the region this weekend to broaden the conservative outreach. And the Republican National Committee has spent more than $1 million on its own operation that was expected to reach 250,000 targeted voters - either by phone or in person - by election day, said RNC spokesman Rick Gorka. Overall, national groups allied with the GOP have spent nearly $8 million on advertising in the race, a figure that doesn't include logistical support on the ground and is more than seven times the amount invested by national Democratic allies unaffiliated with the Lamb campaign. By Saturday afternoon, likely voters were standing in line in near-freezing temperatures for the Trump rally, at Atlantic Aviation, at the Pittsburgh airport. “Heading to Moon Township, Pennsylvania, to be with a really good person, State Representative Rick Saccone, who is running for Congress. Big & happy crowd (why not, some of the best economic numbers ever). Rick will help me a lot. Also, tough on crime & border. Loves 2nd A & VETS,” Trump tweeted before arriving. In recent days, former Vice President Joe Biden has stumped for Lamb. Trump is making is second visit this year to the district. And Vice President Pence has already campaigned along with Saccone.

Eric Buerk holds a sign that reads, \"No Wall No Ban,\" during a protest on Dec. 6, 2017, outside a federal courthouse in Seattle. (Photo: Ted S. Warren, AP) A federal judge in Seattle has partially lifted a Trump administration ban on certain refugees after two advocacy groups argued the policy prevented their clients — all individuals from predominately Muslim countries — from reuniting with family living legally in the United States. U.S. District Judge James Robart issued a preliminary injunction Saturday ordering the federal government to restart processing the applications of refugees “with a bona fide relationship to a person or entity within the United States.” The ruling comes after the ACLU of Washington and the group Jewish Family Service filed a lawsuit arguing that President Trump’s order to tighten refugee policy violates a federal statute created by Congress that allows for people admitted as refugees to be able to resettle their children and spouses in the U.S. as long as they satisfy the government’s established vetting process. “The administration’s policy is ripping apart families and heartlessly keeping refugees who have survived traumatic situations from reuniting with loved ones,” said Enoka Herat, an attorney for ACLU of Washington, after Robart’s ruling. The injunction comes two months after the Trump administration announced it was replacing a 120-day suspension of refugee admissions with a more restrictive policy that would bar thousands of refugees from entering the United States. The newer program specifically bars refugees coming from 11 countries that made up 44% of the 53,716 refugees admitted to the U.S. in the 2017 fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, according to a USA TODAY analysis of State Department data. The 11 countries include Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria and Yemen. In all but two of the countries on the list — North Korea and South Sudan — Islam is the dominant religion. The new rules also meant an indefinite suspension on the admission of refugees’ family members who had already legally settled in the United States. More: Trump wants 'extreme vetting' but experts say it wouldn't have stopped NYC terror attack More: Trump’s new refugee policy would slash entries to U.S. by nearly half In a statement, Department of Justice spokeswoman Lauren Ehrsam said: “We disagree with the Court’s ruling and are currently evaluating the next steps.” The plaintiffs in the federal suit filed in Western Washington include two Iraqi men who served the U.S. military as interpreters in Iraq, a transgender women who faces persecution in her home country of Egypt, and a Somali national who has been in admitted to the U.S. as a refugee but whose wife and child have been barred from entering. The day before Trump issued his executive order, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke and Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats sent a memo to Trump saying certain refugees must be banned unless additional security measures are implemented. But Robart noted in his order that former national security officials — many of whom held “the most senior responsibility within the U.S. government for overseeing the refugee resettlement process” —expressed that they are “unaware of any national security threat that would justify” the new restrictions. “In fact, the former officials detailed concretely how the Agency Memo will harm the United States’ national security and foreign policy interests,” Robart added. “Enjoining portions of the Agency Memo will simply restore refuge procedures and programs to the position they were in prior to its issuance, which already includes ‘the most thorough vetting of any travelers to the United States.’” Contributing: Associated Press Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2C6lxSC.

{"global_context": "On Wednesday, Mayor-elect Lori Lightfoot savored the groundbreaking nature of her Tuesday win. There she was on a morning national news program above the scrolling banner, “Historic First.” We hope she enjoys her spin at rock star status. She’s a former federal prosecutor and outsider who won the mayor’s race with a commanding 74 percent of the vote. This was a change election and voters saw her as an agent of change. We also hope she succeeds. Yet her pledge to shake up and reform City Hall echoes other shakeups and reform movements, not all of them successful. Other rock stars have tumbled from the victory stage to the pothole-pocked asphalt. So on the cusp of Lightfoot’s takeover — she’ll be sworn in May 20 — we offer some advice on avoiding rookie mistakes. To be an effective policymaker, Lightfoot will need to surround herself with smart people who know city government. While there’s a tendency for new administrations — local, state and federal — to sweep out the old guard with an industrial-sized broom, it can be at the expense of critical experience. Lightfoot will need advisers who know how City Hall operates, how the City Council rolls, and how the needs of 50 aldermen vary dramatically. This is a city, after all, where some aldermen spend their discretionary ward funds on geranium gardens and some spend them on the funerals of children felled by gun violence. To be effective, Lightfoot will need top aides who know the nuances of it. All of it. There were times Mayor Rahm Emanuel could have used more sophisticated street smarts. When he closed nearly 50 schools — mostly in minority neighborhoods — in a necessary response to falling enrollment, his administration seemed caught off guard by the prospect of gang conflicts endangering students walking to and from their new schools. City Hall scrambled to expand its “Safe Passage” program, adding crossing guards and other security measures to make the routes safer. Editorial: Here's how Lori Lightfoot can wield her mandate » The takeaway: Mayors can get stuck in ivory towers. Best to include on your team those who know ground zero. A mayoral adviser conversant in the turf wars of the South and West sides would have been a valuable resource for Emanuel. Even a lawyer as gifted as Lightfoot will need guidance navigating City Council processes, including how to introduce and pass an ordinance. Yes, the basics. And despite the influx of new aldermen, Lightfoot will need to make friends with the old ones. Knowing the parliamentary maneuvers that can accelerate, or sidetrack, an important initiative will be paramount to her success. She will need to outsmart the council’s tacticians. She will need a council insider. We’d also recommend a cooperative approach with aldermen, at least publicly and initially. One of the most insurmountable mistakes by former Gov. Bruce Rauner, also elected as a reformer, was his dismissive attitude toward legislators in the General Assembly. He lost leverage by shooing them off, by not engaging sincerely with them, and by publicly blasting them. Rauner’s agenda foundered. Lightfoot could ask Rod Blagojevich, too, about open combat with the legislative branch. The ex-governor frequently critiqued lawmakers en route to alienating most of them. So when time came for an impeachment vote … Lightfoot also can learn from Chicago Mayor Jane Byrne. Elected in 1979, she backed away from campaign pledges to lead a good-government crusade against machine aldermen: Realizing that she couldn’t muster a reform council majority, she cozied up to the very insiders she had reviled. They smiled warmly — and resisted her. But by reversing course, she had alienated the coalition of blacks, liberals and women who had made her Chicago’s first female mayor. We aren’t suggesting that Lightfoot will renege on her reform agenda or be a pushover. The culture of City Hall needs a loofah. But it’s possible to clean up city government and tighten the free rein of aldermen while also accepting and even appreciating constructive pushback. This city and state have had too many elected officials consumed by ego and unable to navigate even mild opposition. We hope Lightfoot will be the exception. As a chief executive, though, Lori Lightfoot is untested. Her legacy as mayor is a whiteboard. But look at the enormous challenges. We hope she’ll accept all the well-intentioned advice she gets, these encouragements included. Join the discussion on Twitter @Trib_Ed_Board and on Facebook.

{"global_context": "By COLLEEN LONG and JILL COLVIN WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is asking Congress for an additional $4.5 billion in emergency spending for border security as the administration contends with a surge of Central American migrants at the southern border. That’s according to two people familiar with the request who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly before a formal announcement. A summary of the request obtained by the AP says the White House wants $3.3 billion for humanitarian aid to increase shelter capacity for unaccompanied migrant children and the feeding and care of families. An additional $1.1 billion would go toward operational support, including personnel expenses, detention beds, transportation and investigative work on smuggling. And the final $178 million would be used for mission support, including technology upgrades. “DHS projects it will exhaust resources well before the end of the fiscal year,” reads the formal request letter to Congress, also obtained by the AP. “Without additional resources, the safety and well-being of law enforcement personnel and migrants are at substantial risk.” It also says the Department of Health and Human Services, which manages the care of migrant children who arrive alone or who are separated from their parents by DHS under certain circumstances, will exhaust its resources by June. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said Tuesday during a congressional hearing that the department was running out of money amid a spike in migrants crossing the southern border. He told a House panel the money would be used for temporary and semi-permanent facilities to process families and children and increase detention, though he didn’t specify a figure then. Nearly 100,000 migrants crossed the border in March, a 12-year high. Customs and Border Protection on Tuesday encountered its largest group to date: 424 people in rural New Mexico.

{"global_context": "Israel was informed of the U.S.-led military strikes in Syria ahead of time, Israeli and American officials confirmed on Saturday. TEL AVIV – Israel was informed of the U.S.-led military strikes in Syria ahead of time, Israeli and American officials confirmed on Saturday morning. In a joint operation with the UK and France, chemical weapons sites, including a storage facility and a research base, were targeted in the pre-dawn hours, constituting the largest military intervention since the Syrian civil war began. The military assault was a response to the chemical weapons attack on the Syrian town of Douma last week in which 42 people died and many others were left gasping for breath and foaming at the mouth. Asked how much advance warning Israel had received, an unnamed official told Reuters, “Between 12 and 24 hours, I believe.” Asked whether Israel was consulted when selecting the targets, the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, “Not to my knowledge.” He added that the strikes were an appropriate response to the “murderous actions” of the Assad regime. “Last year, President Trump made clear that the use of chemical weapons crosses a red line. Tonight, under American leadership, the United States, France and the United Kingdom enforced that line,” the official said. “Syria continues to engage in and provide a base for murderous actions, including those of Iran, that put its territory, its forces and its leadership at risk,” the official added. A spokesperson for the U.S. embassy confirmed that Israel was informed of the action ahead of time. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday said Israel “fully supports” President Donald Trump’s “stand against the use and spread of chemical weapons.” “This morning, under American leadership, the United States, France and the United Kingdom demonstrated that their commitment to the fight against chemical weapons is not limited to declarations,” he said. Netanyahu continued, “Trump’s resolve and Israel’s support remain unchanged” since last year when the U.S. conducted strikes in the war-torn country after a sarin gas attack. “It should be clear to President Assad that his reckless efforts to acquire and use weapons of mass destruction, his wanton disregard for international law and his provision of a forward base for Iran and its proxies endanger Syria,” the prime minister said. The chemical weapons facilities that were targeted were reported to have been evacuated in recent days. Russia’s defense ministry said there were “no victims.” Nevertheless, the strikes were designed to set back Syria’s chemical weapons program “for years,” according to a senior Pentagon official, Lieutenant General Kenneth McKenzie. After some Israeli lawmakers came out in support of the missile strikes, Netanyahu’s office issued a directive of silence. Channel 10 reported that the order was the result of a comment by Housing Minister Yoav Galant, a member of Netanyahu’s security cabinet, who said that the strikes sent “an important signal to the axis of evil — Iran, Syria and Hezbollah.” Galant tweeted that “the use of chemical weapons crosses a red line that humanity is no longer willing to accept.” Yesh Atid leader Yair Lapid also hailed the strikes. “Despite the limited nature of the strike, after a period of silence the civilized world sent a clear message to Assad that it won’t remain silent while he murders children,” Lapid said. “The real test now is the coalition’s ability to maintain the military and diplomatic pressure on the dictator from Damascus. Israel will continue to act against the Iranian presence in Syria and won’t take orders from any regional actor when it comes to our vital security interests.” Trump announced the joint operation on Friday, saying it was a direct response to the toxic gas atttack. “The evil and despicable attack left mothers and fathers, infants and children thrashing in pain and gasping for air. These are not the actions of a man. They are crimes of a monster instead,” Trump said. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the strikes were a “one-time shot” and that there was no additional action planned for the immediate future. Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also confirmed that there were no further strikes in the pipeline. On Saturday, Trump praised the strikes, which the Pentagon said were “successful.” “A perfectly executed strike last night. Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine military,” Trump tweeted early Saturday. “Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished!” In response, Assad vowed the American-led “aggression” will only “make Syria and its people more determined to keep fighting and crushing terrorism in every inch of the country.” Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei described the leaders of the military assault as “criminals.”.

{"global_context": "A suicide bomber struck in Afghanistan's eastern city of Jalalabad on Sunday, killing at least 19 people in the second attack in as many days targeting Taliban fighters, security forces and civilians celebrating a holiday cease-fire. The Taliban later rejected an extension to the cease-fire. Najibullah Kamawal, director of the provincial health department, said another 60 people were wounded in the attack, which struck a crowd of people as they left the governor's compound. Saturday's attack, which also took place in Jalalabad, killed at least 36 people and wounded 65, according to Kamawal, director of the provincial health department. No one has claimed the attacks, but they appear to be the work of the Islamic State group, which is not included in the cease-fire and has clashed with the Taliban in the past. The local IS affiliate has a strong presence in the province. The bomber on Saturday targeted a gathering of Taliban fighters who were celebrating a three-day truce coinciding with the Eid al-Fitr holiday. After the attack, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani announced a nine-day extension of the cease-fire. The chairman of the High Peace Council, a government body charged with negotiating an end to the nearly 17-year war, called on the Taliban to accept the extended cease-fire and join the peace process. \"We hope that the extension of the cease-fire will be announced by the leadership of the Taliban,\" Mohammad Karim Khalili told a press conference in the capital, Kabul. He said there had been an \"exchange of views\" between the government and the Taliban over the past week, without elaborating. But on Sunday the Taliban announced that their cease-fire had ended and they have no intention of extending it. \"The cease-fire was announced by the Taliban for just the three days of the Eid holidays which have come to an end this Sunday evening,\" said Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid in a statement. \"All Mujahidin (Taliban) should continue their operations against foreign invaders and their puppets,\" The Taliban's statement added that their cease-fire for their fighters to celebrate the holiday peacefully and not in response to the government's cease-fire announcement.

But over the past two days Taliban fighters could be seen celebrating the truce alongside Afghan troops and other people in a number of locations. Taliban leaders have at different times expressed interest in holding peace talks to end the conflict. But they have refused to meet with the U.S.-backed government, saying they will only negotiate with the United States directly. They have also demanded the withdrawal of all foreign forces.

{"global_context": "Why Tom Perez and Terry McAuliffe have so much riding on Virginia's Nov. 7 gubernatorial election between Ralph Northam and Ed Gillespie. WASHINGTON — Some of those with the most riding on Virginia's governor race aren't even on the ballot. Tom Perez, the Democratic National Committee chairman, has been fending off donors and DNC members who are jittery over the party's weak fundraising and lack of wins in the Trump era. Just wait until Virginia, Perez has told them. The party leader, who was installed in February, sees the race as so important that the cash-strapped DNC has poured $1.5 million into the contest to date and plans to dispatch virtually its entire Washington headquarters staff to nearby Virginia by Election Day on Nov. 7. Now, with less than two weeks to go before voters pick between Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam and Republican Ed Gillespie in a close race, Perez and others in the party have to prove they can execute a winning strategy — or they will face a chorus of criticism. Play Facebook Twitter Embed Virginia gubernatorial candidate defends his record 8:59 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \"We need a win,\" said Democratic strategist Chris Kofinis, who predicted Northam would prevail. \"If we lose, there will be a lot of concern that the Democratic Party is rudderless in the sea of chaos that is the Trump presidency.\" The DNC doesn't typically invest in gubernatorial races, and the Democratic Governors Association is still the far bigger player in this race. That makes Virginia a test of Perez's ambitious strategy to retool the DNC for competition everywhere, all the time — including in elections this year in Alabama and New Jersey — and it comes at a time of ongoing friction inside the party. But Perez isn't alone among top party figures who are counting on Virginia for a personal boost. The state's governor, Terry McAuliffe, may be hoping to use a Northam victory to help pave the way for his own run for president in 2020. \"It would be a blow to both Perez and McAuliffe if we did not win,\" said Ray Buckley, the New Hampshire Democratic Party chair and longtime DNC member who has clashed with Perez at times. Democrats have chosen friendly turf on which to make a big stand. Virginia is a competitive state, but one Democrats should win, and recent polls give Northam a single-digit edge. They hold the governor's office and both Senate seats, they’ve won Virginia in the last three presidential elections, and it tends to elect governors from the party out of power in the White House. And yet, with two weeks left to go, there's a fear among some Democratic leaders. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, left, makes a point as GOP gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie watches at the Omni Homestead Resort in Hot Springs, Virginia, on July 22. Bob Brown / Richmond Times-Dispatch via AP The party's nominee is less than thrilling. Democrats are still divided in the aftermath of the Bernie Sanders-Hillary Clinton presidential primary last year. And Republicans perform better in off-year elections. To top it off, recent polls have been all over the place, with Northam leading Gillespie by as much as 14 points in one poll and trailing by a single point in another. Democratic operatives say they're confident that Northam will pull it out. But, after a series of relatively narrow special election losses this year, the political class is closely watching the first fair fight since Trump's election last November. The anxiety is acute enough that McAuliffe has told confidants his reputation is on the line. Any presidential aspirations he harbors would surely be damaged if Northam — his hand-picked candidate — doesn’t prevail. \"What will hurt him is if he doesn’t pass the baton to a Democrat,\" said one longtime Virginia Democratic operative. On the other hand, the operative said, \"if we win this thing, it's going to be a big deal for him.\" McAuliffe has helped put over $1 million into the race and knows his legacy is on the line. \"It's critical for us to keep that governor's mansion,\" McAuliffe said in an interview with NBC News earlier this year. \"If we don't have a Democrat in the governor's office in Virginia, all the things that we have done...they're going to roll those back.\" And a loss has the potential to kickstart another round of Sanders-Clinton camp feuding. Our Revolution, which grew out of Sanders' presidential campaign, decided to sit out the Virginia governor's race, irking some Democrats involved in the contest who worry about progressives staying home on Election Day because their favored candidate, former Rep. Tom Perriello, lost the primary. \"As for Northam, our local groups make recommendations to the national organization for endorsements and his name was not recommended,\" said Our Revolution spokesperson Diane May, noting the group has endorsed state legislature candidates and will work to turn out voters on Nov. 7. Meanwhile, the outcome could influence the way tens of millions of dollars of liberal money is spent in the future. A slew of deep-pocketed outside groups that typically work on their own, including Priorities USA, the League of Conservation Voters and Planned Parenthood's political arm, experimented with pooling their resources for a $2 million digital campaign that could be a model for the future. And all the fretting has led some Democrats to worry that worrying is the party's bigger problem. \"We can't continue to angst existentially over every single race,\" said Colm O'Comartun, the former executive director of the Democratic Governors Association.

{"global_context": "CIA director nominee Gina Haspel, who would be the first woman to lead the spy agency, is expected to pass a key committee vote that  congressional source told Reuters is now set for Wednesday. CIA director nominee Gina Haspel, who would be the first woman to lead the spy agency, is expected to pass a key committee vote that a congressional source told Reuters is now set for Wednesday. The U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee will reportedly hold the vote behind closed doors, which is its traditional procedure. If approved by the committee, Haspel's nomination would head to the Senate, which is expected to narrowly confirm her appointment. A second Democrat on Saturday said he would vote in favor of Haspel, even as Republican Sens. John McCain and Rand Paul have signaled they will buck President Trump and oppose her historic nomination. Republicans hold a slim 51-49 majority in the Senate, with Vice President Pence able to break any tie vote. The Democratic support gives Haspel's contentious nomination some much-needed breathing room. Democrats and some Republicans have expressed concern about Haspel’s involvement in the post 9/11-era interrogation and detention programs. But Sen. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., this week announced that after a “tough, frank and extensive discussion,” with Haspel, he would join fellow a Democrat, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, in supporting her nomination. WATCH: GREEN BERET WATERBOARDS HIMSELF TO SUPPORT HASPEL'S NOMINATION Haspel headed up a base at a Thailand black-site prison in 2002. Enhanced interrogation techniques, such as waterboarding, were employed against terror suspects at the site. Speaking at her confirmation hearing on Wednesday, Haspel vowed change in the CIA's interrogation operations. “Having served in that tumultuous time, I can offer you my personal commitment, clearly and without reservation, that under my leadership on my watch CIA will not restart such a detention and interrogation program,” she said. However, Haspel refused to condemn past interrogation practices as \"immoral,\" despite intense prodding from California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris. And some Republicans who support Haspel have also spoken out in support of enhanced interrogation techniques. In an interview with Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo this week, former Vice President Dick Cheney said the techniques, such as waterboarding, helped aid in the capture of Usama bin Laden in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terror attacks. \"Waterboarding was applied actually to only three individuals — one of those was Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of 9/11,\" Cheney said on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" Cheney added that Mohammed was a \"preeminent source\" of information on Al Qaeda, according to a classified report.

{"global_context": "U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO) has told multiple reporters he's undecided on the latest GOP bill to kill Obamacare, in part, as he told KOA radio this mor... U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO) has told multiple reporters he's undecided on the latest GOP bill to kill Obamacare, in part, as he told KOA radio this morning, because he wants to see \"whether Colorado is better or worse\" under the legislation. But every analysis of the bill so far, like the one from the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, shows that Colorado will be worse off. Gov. John Hickenlooper told reporters yesterday that the legislation would cost the state $800 million to $1 billion in federal health-care dollars. And it's widely predicted that millions of people would lose health insurance under the latest GOP bill, just as they would under previous GOP proposals that upend Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for children, elderly, disabled, and other poor people. So it's hard to know what information Gardner is waiting for. In fact, when asked directly by Denver Post political reporter Mark Matthews what specific information he's looking for, Gardner replied, \"just additional information.\" Strangely, though, Gardner told KDMT’s Jimmy Sengenberger last month that the Cassidy-Graham bill would put the country in the \"right direction\" on health care and \"could result in a 42 percent increase in funding for the state of Colorado.\" Gardner: But it does sound like [Cassidy-Graham] could result in a 42% increase in funding for the state of Colorado. And so, I just need to learn more about it.” Gardner did not divulge where he got this information and a call to his office was not immediately returned today. On KOA radio, Gardner said of the latest Obamacare replacement bill, \"I hope it has bipartisan participation and support.\" It's not clear why Gardner or anyone would express hope for the unreal outcome of bipartisan support, given the GOP's seven-year partisan campaign to kill Obamacare. Could Gardner possibly be trying to score political points with rhetoric that's completely divorced from reality? Here are Gardner's full comments from KOA, followed by his comments to The Post. GARDNER: Yeah, there is going to be a hearing on this, I believe on Monday, next week. So, we’ll have an open hearing which is something that I have encouraged to have happen. I hope it has bipartisan participation and support. Look, I think one of the things we need to do is focus on driving down the cost of healthcare. And I have confidence that states can come up with solutions do just that, because [inaudible—“when it comes to”?] states like Colorado come up with really good solutions. It is not always just Washington. And so, I’ve got more information that we’re seeking. There’s some information that we don’t have yet, in terms of the numbers of what it means and its impact to Colorado. And whether Colorado is better or worse, we’ve got to figure that out. HOST APRIL ZESBAUGH: But Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of your colleagues, says if we don't effectively tweak Obamacare we’re on our way to a single-payer system. Do you share that sentiment? GARDNER: I am concerned that there is a great support right now for a single-payer system. It is a $32 trillion tab on Bernie Sanders’ legislation that he introduced, on Medicare For All. The Colorado voters defeated – that’s the single-payer system, that’s socialized medicine, that’s just a code word they’re using -- but if you look at Colorado, we defeated the single-payer healthcare system -- the Medicare For All system -- 80% to 20%, at the same time Hillary Clinton was getting elected in November. So, it’s something Colorado voters have already rejected. And I am concerned that, left on its own, the Affordable Care Act could lead to some who want to do single-payer.

{"global_context": "This time, there were fewer hugs. President Donald Trump welcomed German Chancellor Angela Merkel to the White House on Friday for a visit of less than three hours. He greeted Merkel outside the West Wing with a handshake and a kiss on each cheek, a traditional welcome but far short of the bountiful display of personal warmth that was seen earlier in the week when he played host to French President Emmanuel Macron for a lavish three-day state visit. Trump, in brief remarks alongside Merkel in the Oval Office, called her an \"extraordinary woman,\" congratulated her on her recent re-election and disputed any idea that their rapport was frosty. \"We have a really great relationship. We actually have had a great relationship from the beginning,\" Trump said. Though her visit will be short on pomp, Merkel's message was similar to Macron's — that America and Europe need to bury the hatchet on key issues, from global trade to international security. In a joint press conference Friday afternoon, it was apparent that despite the back-to-back visits, Trump's divisions with Europe are still substantial. Trump is widely expected to withdraw the U.S. from the Iran nuclear accord next month, despite pleas from Macron earlier this week and Merkel Friday. Merkel used her meeting with Trump to try to paper over the differences, calling the Obama-era agreement a \"first step\" toward curtailing and containing Iran's regional ambitions and suggesting openness to a side agreement. Trump has said he was open to new negotiations with Iran, but has not said whether he would heed European calls for the U.S. to stay in the deal, which aims to restrict Iran's nuclear efforts, while those talks are underway. His decision is expected by May 12. On trade, Merkel said there was little progress on seeking permanent exemptions for the EU from Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs. \"The decision lies with the president,\" she said. Trump implicitly scolded Germany for not meeting its defense spending obligations to NATO, saying, it is \"essential that our NATO allies increase their financial contribution,\" to the pact. Merkel said Germany's latest budget will take defense spending to 1.3 percent of GDP. She acknowledged that's far short of the 2 percent goal but said Germany is still aiming for that over time. In the hours before Merkel's arrival at the White House, Trump himself took note of their limited schedule, which was to include a 30-minute Oval Office meeting, followed by a working lunch and joint news conference. \"Look forward to meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany today,\" Trump tweeted. \"So much to discuss, so little time! It will be good for both of our great countries!\" While Macron and Trump went to great lengths to display their affection through hearty handshakes, hugs — and, at times, air kisses — the president has not displayed the same chemistry with Merkel. In their first White House meeting last spring, Trump seemed to ignore photographers' prompts to give Merkel the traditional photo-op handshake. And the German chancellor looked on unhappily when Trump upbraided NATO nations last summer for not spending enough on defense as he stood in NATO'S gleaming new Brussels headquarters. This time, the two exchanged a handshake in the Oval Office. Kellyanne Conway, a senior counselor to Trump, said that the president's relationships with Merkel and Macron don't need to be compared. \"France and Germany are great allies. I think every leader is different, every relationship is different,\" Conway said at the White House. \"We're very happy that Chancellor Merkel is making another trip here.\" While Macron has been positioning himself as Europe's \"Trump whisperer\" and conduit to an American president who seems intent on upending U.S. relationships with allies, Merkel maintains her strength as the head of the largest economy in Europe. And if this visit produces a similar lack of bonhomie, that might just be fine with Merkel, who has little to gain at home by being overly friendly with Trump, according to German political analyst Jan Techau. \"For Merkel, it's quite important domestically not to be seen to be getting too close to Trump,\" said Techau, a senior fellow at think tank The German Marshall Fund of the United States. Anti-American sentiment has been growing again in Germany since Trump's election, with mainstream media regularly portraying the U.S. president as a threat to the world. The Macron state visit had been long planned, while Merkel's more informal working visit was added to the schedule so her trip to Washington would be the first outside Europe since her election victory. Two deadlines loom large. The first is Trump's demand for an overhaul by May 12 of the international nuclear deal with Iran — an agreement that Germany, like France, worked hard to secure and believes should remain in place. Although Germany is unlikely to accept a wholesale rewrite of the deal, Berlin has indicated that it is prepared to consider add-ons that would crack down on Tehran's ballistic missile program and curb Iranian efforts to strengthen its strategic role in the Middle East. Earlier this week, Macron made clear that France would not follow the U.S. lead if Trump decides to withdraw from the agreement. Macron later told French reporters that he has no \"inside information\" on Trump's decision on the Iran deal but noted that it's clear the U.S. president \"is not very much eager to defend it.\" The second deadline concerns the extension of new U.S. tariffs on foreign-made steel and aluminum, which some fear could trigger a global wave of protectionism that would deeply harm a trading nation such as Germany. Though German officials have signaled that their goals for the visit are modest, Berlin last week announced plans to step up defense spending, a long-standing demand in Washington. While Germany is still likely to miss the goal of devoting 2 percent of its gross domestic product to defense that's expected of NATO members, the move could be taken as a sign that Berlin has gotten the message. Some German officials have been quietly playing with the idea of buying U.S.-made F-35 jets replace the country's aging fleet of Tornado planes. The hope is that this would show Berlin's willingness to act on military spending while also improving the U.S. trade balance with Germany. Associated Press writer Frank Jordans contributed reporting from Berlin.

{"global_context": "California's Senate leader on Friday expanded an effort to transfer sexual harassment investigations to outside experts, while taking action to remove a Los Angeles lawmaker accused of inappropriate behavior from his committee assignments. The decision by Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León (D-Los Angeles) comes less than one day after the latest accusation against Sen. Tony Mendoza (D-Artesia). Mendoza would be suspended from his chairmanship of the Senate Banking and Financial Institutions Committee, as well as other \"boards and commissions\" pending the outcome of an investigation, according to a statement from De León's office. The Senate Rules Committee would be asked to formally approve that action later this month. \"Like many in our Caucus, I’m deeply troubled by the quantity and specificity of accusations against Senator Mendoza — and have therefore determined that Senator Mendoza should be suspended from Chairmanships, boards and commissions until the independent investigation into his conduct is complete,\" the Senate leader said in a written statement. The Senate Rules Committee will meet in emergency session later this month to consider the action against Mendoza, he said. Mendoza, who shared a Sacramento house with De León until last week, was not immediately available for comment Friday, but he has denied sexually harassing former employees — including one who he allegedly invited to his home to work on her resume, and another who said he sent her texts after hours. “I am hopeful that the recent unsubstantiated allegations in the media will be addressed fairly and transparently,” Mendoza said in a statement Thursday. He also denounced a directive by the Senate Rules Committee preventing him from responding to allegations and not providing him with details about them. De León also announced Friday more details about how the Senate will hand over sexual harassment investigations to an independent law firm, a decision he made Sunday evening. Three lawmakers will sit on a panel tasked with picking the law firm, serving alongside the Legislature's attorney, the Senate secretary and the leader of a trade association representing registered Capitol lobbyists. Law firms will be interviewed the week after Thanksgiving, and a firm with a \"prior existing professional or political relationship\" with the Senate or senators will be disqualified, according to the statement from De León's office. Mendoza, who is also a member of the Senate's budget, education, governmental organization and transportation committees, was elected to the Senate in 2014 after serving six years in the Assembly. Saeed Ali, a spokesman for Mendoza, said Friday that he did not think the proposed suspension included regular membership on Senate policy committees.

{"global_context": "A number of foreign countries are set to become key players in the country's future. Image copyright Getty Images Civil wars that spread devastation and suffering across a whole country have no real victors. But one war in Syria - that against the Islamic State (IS) group's so-called caliphate - is well on the way to being won. Earlier this week IS's last urban bastion in eastern Syria, Deir al-Zour, hard up against the Iraqi border, fell to Assad government forces. IS will remain in some form or another as an insurgency and source of ideological inspiration but as a territorial entity or physical caliphate, it is finished. But what of Syria's other war, the uprising against the Assad regime and its efforts - aided by Iran and Russia - to crush the opposition? The current situation on the ground means that forces from the above countries will be in close proximity to United States troops, who are supporting some of the anti-Assad groups. Joshua Landis, a Syria expert and professor at Oklahoma University, summed it up in simple terms. \"Assad has won the Syria war militarily,\" he told me. \"He has defeated the original uprising or revolution. The rebel groups that remain have been pushed to the margins of Syria. \"The international community has all but abandoned them as a lost cause. The rebel militias,\" he argues, \"still have some teeth in defence, but cannot mount a credible offensive against Assad's military.\" Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, and another close watcher of Syria, has a slightly more cautious assessment. \"President Assad,\" he notes, \"sits more comfortably in Damascus than at any time since 2011.\" Interactive Slide the button to see how the area IS controls has changed since 2015 2017 2015 But having said that, he argues that \"it would be inaccurate to suggest Assad had won the war. He's simply avoided losing it.\" \"The Assad regime has a stated intent to recapture every inch of Syria. If that goal is to ever be met, we're talking years at least,\" he explained. But the crucial take-away from all this is that Syria is entering a new phase of conflict. The territorial defeat of IS, says Charles Lister, \"will throw an awful lot of potential sources of hostility up into the air and nobody really knows right now how they'll land\". What is emerging is a new strategic map with Syria divided into different zones: One controlled by the Assad regime (with the support of Russia and Iran), another controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (an amalgam of Kurdish, Arab and other groups supported by the US), and others run by various elements of the Syrian opposition, backed to varying degrees by Turkey and Jordan. Having helped Assad restore his control over a significant part of the Syrian population, Moscow has also manoeuvred itself into holding the best cards in the putative diplomatic end-game. As Joshua Landis told me, the Astana peace process, led by the Russians, \"is the only one worth anything at the moment. \"The Geneva process, led by the US,\" he notes, \"has been about grandstanding and sticking to talking points that no longer have any relevance on the ground, such as demanding that Assad step aside and that democratic elections be held in Syria. Everyone knows this will not happen.\" With the demise of IS, Syria's future will continue to be determined by a variety of external players, fighting out their own strategic battles and seeking local advantage. The four key actors are the US, Russia, Turkey and Iran. The United States Image copyright Getty Images Special forces from Western countries, including the US, have supported Kurdish-Arab forces in Syria Its initial half-hearted efforts to galvanise a democratic opposition to defeat the Syrian regime failed dramatically. Its focus has largely been on the defeat of the IS caliphate. But now, Joshua Landis says, Washington must make a decision: \"Will it stay in Northern Syria to defend the gains of the Syrian Democratic Forces that it has armed, trained and propelled to victory in Raqqa and the region north of the Euphrates River?\" The difficulty, as Charles Lister told me, is that \"beyond fighting IS, it is sadly very hard to determine whether the US really has a Syria policy.\" And he says that what policy there is is full of contradictions. For example, Washington continues to say Assad must leave and that his days are numbered, and yet the US has ceased all support to anyone opposed to Assad. Turkey Image copyright Getty Images Turkish President Erdogan's main concern is with the Kurds If US policy could be said to be in a mess, so too could that of Turkey. Ankara's goal, says Joshua Landis, is to retrench. \"It seriously overreached in Syria,\" he told me, \"almost to the point of destabilising Turkey.\" He believes that President Erdogan \"must make sure that the Kurdish question in Turkey does not lurch toward civil war. He will increasingly normalise relations with Assad in order to contain the independence of Syria's Kurds.\" Turkish troops have moved a small way into northern Syria to achieve this goal. Indeed, after posing as a champion of the opposition against the Assad regime, Charles Lister says, that \"at times, Turkey has directly betrayed the opposition groups it had stood by for so long, merely to secure a more favourable position against the Kurdish YPG, which it views as a terrorist organisation. Iran Image copyright Getty Images Shia militias, backed by Tehran, have played a prominent role in the campaign against IS In backing the Assad regime (and offering significant support to the Shia-dominated government in Iraq) Tehran has had one clear goal - to secure its hegemony in the northern Middle East: the lands stretching from Lebanon through Syria and Iraq, all the way to Iran's own borders. \"This,\" says Joshua Landis, \"is the new security architecture that Iran has fought so vigorously for and it is within its reach today. This means that Iran can counter-balance Israel. It means that Iran can establish oil pipelines running to the Mediterranean coast, trade routes, highways, and pilgrimage routes.\" This, he says, means \"Iran is no longer cut out of the Middle East.\" And Tehran has troops to back up its position. Charles Lister notes that Iran \"commands tens of thousands of Shia militiamen inside Syria, which gives Tehran more influence than any other actor, bar none.\" Russia Image copyright Getty Images Russian troops have been on the ground in Syria Russia, after Iran, is the other great winner from the Syrian conflict, reviving its role in the region, securing important military bases, and making itself a key diplomatic player. It wants to \"solve\" Syria on its terms and with its favoured actors ending up the victors and it seems to be well on the way to achieving this goal. But the growing proximity of Russian and Iranian-backed pro-regime forces and those backed by the US raises the possibility of some dangerous encounters. The US and Russia can agree on the need to defeat IS but on little else. Moscow's \"side\" has the military and diplomatic advantage on the ground. Will the US seek to bolster its position in Syria, perhaps as part of a broader policy to \"roll back\" Iranian influence, as US conservatives are hoping? This may be easier said than done and might require many more resources and boots-on-the-ground than the Trump administration is prepared to put in harm's way.

{"global_context": "Too often, members of Congress don't know how to or won't informatively interview expert witnesses, therefore wasting the fact-finding opportunity. CLOSE Michael Cohen testified in front of the House Oversight and Reform Committee on Wednesday. Cohen called Trump a 'conman,' a 'cheat,' and 'fundamentally disloyal.' USA TODAY Too often, members of Congress don't know how to or won't informatively interview expert witnesses, therefore wasting the fact-finding opportunity. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., did a masterful job interrogating former Donald Trump attorney Michael Cohen during the House Oversight Committee hearing — and in so doing, underscored an inherent rhetorical problem with how members of Congress interview witnesses. For more than 40 years, I have taught a course in argumentation at the University of Texas. One of the major distinctions discussed in this class is the difference between argument as “advocacy” and argument as \"inquiry\" — the former focusing primarily on explicit appeals to persuade and the latter emphasizing discovery. This distinction is especially useful when evaluating congressional hearings. For example, I have observed that more often than not, members of Congress do not know how to — or won’t — ask genuine and useful questions. Their penchant is to practice argument as advocacy. Read more commentary: Michael Cohen's testimony, if true, confirms Trump's crimes Why Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez should support eliminating limits on campaign contributions Don't cover up Mueller's Trump-Russia investigation. We need to know everything he finds. Rather than engaging in inquiry, members spend their questioning time making speeches and asking rhetorical questions designed to lead to a predetermined political claim. They posture and dramatically draw attention to themselves — which, of course, is why the news media are titillated and hence spend an inordinate amount of time including their questioning in a seemingly endless news loop. From a nonpartisan perspective, Ocasio-Cortez (and perhaps a few others) were the exception to the rule during the Feb. 27 hearing. She practiced argument as inquiry. Her questions were probative and focused on discovery, setting up future lines of inquiry, obtaining new information, and discerning additional witnesses who might testify. Unlike others, hers was not an exercise in self-promotion. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez slams 'fundamentally broken' campaign finance system (Photo: OVERSIGN COMMITTEE) For example, Ocasio-Cortez asked Cohen several specific questions about how President Donald Trump handled insurance claims and whether he provided accurate information to various companies. “To your knowledge,” she inquired, “did Donald Trump ever provide inflated assets to an insurance company?” He had, Cohen said. She also asked whether Trump had attempted to reduce his local taxes by undervaluing his assets. Cohen said the president had also done that. Most important, she asked, “Do you think we need to review financial statements and tax returns in order to compare them?” She pressed Cohen for the names of others who would be able to corroborate the testimony or provide documents to support the charges — to which he listed the executives Allen Weisselberg, Ron Lieberman and Matthew Calamari, individuals who eventually may be called to testify. AOC was refreshing It was refreshing to see that the rhetorical uniqueness of Ocasio-Cortez’s questioning was noted by the news media and political pundits. The larger point to be made, extending well beyond the Cohen hearing, is that too often members of Congress — Republicans and Democrats — don’t know how to or won’t informatively interview expert witnesses and persons with relevant personal experience. Whether the subject is environmental, social welfare or other important issues, senators and representatives engage in argument as advocacy; they handpick witnesses who reflect members’ partisan conclusions, cherry-pick answers, and generally substitute posturing, self-promotion and speech-making for questioning. What a waste of time and ignorance of the fact-finding purpose of questioning. This might explain why many of our public policies are not grounded in sufficient knowledge of the problems being addressed. Just imagine what these hearings would look like if their primary objective were inquiry rather than advocacy — if witnesses were allowed to testify and interact for the purpose of discovery. As my students learn, this more informative rhetorical format for questioning leads to genuine persuasion and compromise, and that is the ultimate objective of argument and the basis for informed and reasoned decision-making.

{"global_context": "They spent their first year in Washington as an untouchable White House power couple, commanding expansive portfolios, outlasting rivals and enjoying unmatched access to the president. But Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump have undergone a swift and stunning reckoning of late, their powers restricted, their enemies emboldened and their future in the West Wing uncertain. Kushner, long the second-most powerful man in the West Wing, is under siege. President Donald Trump's son-in-law has lost influential White House allies. He remains under the shadow of the Russia probe and has seen his business dealings come under renewed scrutiny. He has been stripped of his top security clearance, raising questions how he can successfully advance his ambitious agenda — including achieving Mideast peace, a goal that has eluded presidents for generations. Kushner's most powerful patron, the president himself, has wavered recently on whether his daughter and son-in-law belong in the White House anymore. A frustrated Trump has griped about the wave of bad headlines generated by probes into Kushner's business dealings and the status of his security clearance, according to two people familiar with the president's thinking but not authorized to publicly discuss private conversations. The president also has wondered aloud if the couple would be better off returning home to New York. At the same time, though, Trump has said he believes many of the attacks against Kushner are unfair and has lamented that the couple is going through such a turbulent time, according to the two people close to the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly about Trump's private comments. \"I think he's been treated very unfairly,\" Trump said late last month. \"He's a high-quality person.\" Kushner's woes mushroomed in the past month, when accusations of spousal abuse emerged against White House staff secretary Rob Porter. Initially, the resulting firestorm — including questions about how Porter had interim clearance for top-secret information despite red flags in his background — threatened to engulf Chief of Staff John Kelly, the retired Marine hired to bring order to Trump's chaotic West Wing. Kelly seemed to stabilize his own standing, in part by ordering a reform of the White House security clearance process. And among senior aides, that change fell the hardest on Kushner, who had been working with interim access to top-secret information. And he was doing that as investigators worked through his family's complicated real estate dealings and as special counsel Robert Mueller probes Russian connections to the Trump team. A week ago, Kushner's security clearance level was downgraded, leaving White House aides to wonder just how many indignities Kushner and Ivanka Trump are willing to suffer. Even if recent events and revelations don't trigger a departure, they have demonstrated that the West Wing clout of \"Javanka,\" as the couple is often referred to, is a far cry from what it once was. Since taking office last year, Kelly has prioritized creating formal lines of authority and decision-making. Kushner resisted efforts to formalize his role — which early in the administration made him something of a shadow secretary of state — and he has grown frustrated with the chief of staff's attempts to restrict the couple's access to the president. The couple perceives Kelly's crackdown on security clearances as a direct shot at them, according to White House aides and outside advisers. But one White House official disputed that account, suggesting that Kushner welcomed Kelly's efforts to organize the West Wing, allowing him to more singularly focus on his portfolio. Kelly, in turn, has been angered by what he views as the couple's freelancing. He blames them for changing Trump's mind at the last minute and questions what exactly they do all day, according to one White House official and an outside ally. Kushner prevailed in previous power struggles within the White House, including one against former chief strategist Steve Bannon, but allies of the president on the outside openly cheered the power couple's weakened position. \"Only a son-in-law could withstand this sort of exposure and not be fired,\" said Jennifer Palmieri, former communications director for President Barack Obama. \"Kushner's vulnerable and in an accelerated fall from grace. Even though his departure would leave Trump even more isolated, a decision could be made that it's just not worth it for him to stay.\" Those close to the couple insist the duo has no plans to leave Washington. But a soft landing spot has emerged if they choose to take it. At a senior staff meeting Wednesday, Kushner spoke about the 2020 campaign at Kelly's behest, talking up the selection of Brad Parscale to run the campaign, according to an administration official who was not authorized to speak publicly about internal discussions. Kushner has a close relationship with Parscale, whom he recruited to work on the 2016 campaign. News of Parscale's appointment was first reported in the Drudge Report, a favored outlet of Kushner's, in a move that was seen by some in the West Wing as an attempted reminder of Kushner's clout just hours before his humbling security clearance downgrade became public. One veteran of the 2016 campaign suggested that there had always been a tentative plan for Kushner to resume a role on the re-election campaign but not this early in the president's first term. In a White House populated with attention-seekers, Kushner has been an ascetic, discreet figure. Almost always standing at the periphery in dark business suits, Kushner is rarely heard in public, his impact felt but not seen. His diplomatic trips abroad have either been shrouded in secrecy or conducted with minimal media coverage. \"I am not a person who has sought the spotlight. First in my business and now in public service, I have worked on achieving goals, and have left it to others to work on media and public perception,\" Kushner told congressional investigators in a prepared statement last July. But it is not immediately obvious what he's achieved. There has been little progress on Mideast peace and relations with Mexico, another top Kushner priority, remain contentious over Trump's proposed border wall. Kushner's much ballyhooed project to reinvent the federal government has gained little traction. And questions persist about his family business's global hunt for cash just a year before a $1.2 billion mortgage on a Manhattan skyscraper must be paid off by the company and a partner in the building.

{"global_context": "A new poll shows a large number of Americans don't want Trump for a second term. Former vice president Joe Biden is getting winks and nudges to declare his political ambitions for 2020. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) More than half of Americans are uninterested in keeping President Trump around for a second term, according to a new poll. But to be fair, considering his historically low approval ratings, this is not that surprising. But what is surprising is who Americans want as the next president — and who they don't. A recent Quinnipiac poll says that more Americans would vote for former vice president Joe Biden than Trump. It certainly wouldn't be a landslide win: 48 percent of respondents said they'd pick Biden, while 44 percent said they'd elect the president for a second term. Biden has not ruled out running in 2020, after opting not to enter the race in 2016, citing the death of his son Beau Biden and a need to focus on family. But, if elected, Biden would be 78 years old when entering the White House. The former vice president ranks at No. 2 behind Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on The Fix's list of top 2020 contenders. While Biden is No. 2 on the list, it's not as firmly as before, after a recent spate of sexual harassment allegations against politicians — and the reevaluation of past allegations — put Biden's handling of the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings back in the spotlight, Aaron Blake reported. And speaking of the #MeToo movement, the buzz around Oprah Winfrey after her campaign-style speech during the Golden Globes, confirmed that she would beat the president. According to the poll, she would get 52 percent of the vote to Trump's 39 percent. But 66 percent of respondents said electing a celebrity as president is a bad idea. One particular lawmaker who is considered a front-runner by many liberals would not appear to have the support needed to beat Trump: Sanders. When asked whether they’d be inclined to vote for Sanders over Trump, 55 percent of those surveyed said no. It has become a common argument on the left when lamenting Trump that had Sanders been the Democratic nominee over Hillary Clinton, he would have attracted enough support to beat Trump. The argument is that liberals who did not back Clinton would have voted for Sanders, along with some of the white working-class voters and men who ultimately chose Trump. However, this most recent poll suggests that would not be the case today. The poll also revealed potential support for Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, the lawmaker from New York who holds Clinton’s former seat in the Senate. When asked whether they would be inclined to vote for Gillibrand, 49 percent of Americans said “no” while only 13 percent said “yes.” Gillibrand's name has been thrown around as a possible 2020 candidate and has attracted quite a bit of attention recently for public stances on sexual misconduct. She helped lead the call for former senator Al Franken (D-Minn.) to resign following allegations of sexual misconduct and even said former president Bill Clinton should have resigned, which sent shock waves through Democratic circles. Gillibrand has also spoken out in support of single-payer health care, a policy Sanders pushed during the 2016 campaign. The survey did not poll Americans on other hypothetical 2020 candidates, including Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) or Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.). But what is clear is that more than half of Americans seem uninterested in allowing Trump to remain in the White House for another term. In a question in which no opponent is named, 62 percent of respondents said that they would not be inclined to vote for Trump; 34 percent said they would. “President Donald Trump can’t seem to improve his approval rating, perhaps because of the troubling fact that half of the voters we spoke to think he is mentally unstable,” said Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll. “The president is a divider, not a uniter, say an overwhelming number of voters, an assessment made even more disturbing by his perceived lack of respect for people of color.”.

{"global_context": "By ELLEN KNICKMEYER | Associated Press WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Tuesday came out with new rules scaling back Obama-era constraints on coal-fired power plants, striking at one of the former administration’s legacy programs to rein in climate-changing fossil-fuel emissions. The Environmental Protection Agency called the Obama-era regulations on coal power plants “overly prescriptive and burdensome.” The Trump administration plan broadly increases the leeway given states to decide how and how much to regulate coal power plants. The EPA says it “empowers states, promotes energy independence, and facilitates economic growth and job creation.” Combined with the EPA’s proposal earlier this month to ease mileage requirements for vehicles, the move may actually increase the country’s climate-changing emissions, according to some former top EPA officials, environmental groups, and other opponents. The Natural Resources Defense Council called the replacement proposal Trump’s “Dirty Power Plan.” Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey cited this summer’s wildfires and increasing droughts and coastal flooding as evidence that man-made climate change from burning coal and other fossil fuels is already well upon the United States. “Once again, this administration is choosing polluters’ profits over public health and safety,” he said. Scientists say that without extensive study they cannot directly link a single weather event to climate change, but climate change is responsible for more intense and more frequent extreme events such as storms, droughts, floods and wildfires. In a statement, Republican Sen. John Barrasso from the coal state of Wyoming welcomed the overhaul of the Obama administration’s 2015 regulations, called the Clean Power Plan. The new proposal establishes emission guidelines for states to use when developing any plans to limit climate-changing emissions from power plants. Critics say the new plan would allow utilities to run older, dirtier power plants more often and extend the plants’ overall operating life, undercutting potential environmental benefits. President Donald Trump is expected to promote the new plan at an appearance in West Virginia on Tuesday. Trump has already vowed to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement as he pushes to revive the coal industry. The Obama administration had worked to nudge the country’s power producers to natural gas, wind and solar power, and other less-polluting power sources. Trump also has directed Energy Secretary Rick Perry to take steps to bolster struggling coal-fired and nuclear power plants to keep them open, warning that impending retirements of “fuel-secure” power plants that rely on coal and nuclear power are harming the nation’s power grid and reducing its resilience. Obama’s plan was designed to cut U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The rule dictated specific emission targets for states based on power-plant emissions and gave officials broad latitude to decide how to achieve reductions. The Supreme Court put the plan on hold in 2016 following a legal challenge by industry and coal-friendly states, an order that remains in effect. Even so, the Obama plan has been a factor in a wave of retirements of coal-fired plants, which also are being squeezed by lower costs for natural gas and renewable power and state mandates that promote energy conservation. Trump has vowed to end what Republicans call a “war on coal” waged by Obama. “They are continuing to play to their base and following industry’s lead,” Gina McCarthy, EPA administrator when the Obama plan was developed, said of the Trump administration and its new acting administrator, Andrew Wheeler, a former coal industry lobbyist. “This is all about coal at all costs.” Michelle Bloodworth, president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, a trade group that represents coal producers, called the new rule a marked departure from the “gross overreach” of the Obama administration and said it should prevent a host of premature coal-plant retirements. “We agree with those policymakers who have become increasingly concerned that coal retirements are a threat to grid resilience and national security,” she said. Tuesday’s move opens a public-comment period on the proposal before any final administration action. Associated Press writer Matthew Daly contributed to this report.

{"global_context": "Trump's preoccupation with getting allies to spend 2% on defense often misrepresents their NATO obligations. CLOSE President Donald Trump singles out Germany Thursday for not paying their NATO commitments during a meeting at the White House with Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. (May 17) AP President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump walk down the stairway of Air Force One as they arrive at Melsbroek Military airport in Melsbroek, Belgium, TuesdayTrump is in Brussels to attend a two-day NATO summit. (Photo: Geert Vanden Wijngaert, AP) BRUSSELS — President Donald Trump arrived Tuesday at the home of NATO headquarters with a seemingly singular preoccupation: allies who aren't sharing in the burden of providing for the collective defense. His rallying cry: \"2 percent.\" That's the amount NATO members are expected to spend on defense as a share of their economies. Only four of 29 allies meet that target. The latest salvo came in two tweets from Air Force One, in which he misrepresented the arrangement by which allies contribute to their joint defense. The squabbling over who pays for the protection afforded by the alliance has already set a combative tone for the two-day NATO summit in Brussels this week, as the allies discuss its response to Russia's growing military, political and cyber incursions into Europe. \"Many countries in NATO, which we are expected to defend, are not only short of their current commitment of 2% (which is low), but are also delinquent for many years in payments that have not been made. Will they reimburse the U.S.?\" Trump tweeted. A 2014 agreement did require members to increase defense spending, with a goal of contributing 2 percent of the nation's economic output by 2024. But more importantly, that spending is on their own defense forces — not payments to the United States. But Trump is correct that only four NATO members — the United States, the United Kingdom, Estonia and Greece — currently meet the 2 percent expectation. A fifth country, Poland, fell to 1.99 percent his year, as faster-than-expected economic growth outpaced defense budgets. Diplomats say Trump's singular focus on the 2 percent benchmark might be counterproductive. \"The more he harangues allies, and the more he makes this the defining issue, the more difficult it will be for some allies actually to increase spending,\" said Ivo Daalder, the U.S. ambassador to NATO from 2009 to 2013. \"Given that Trump’s popularity in Europe is at an historic low for a US president, acceding to his demands is becoming more difficult for many European leaders.\" European Council President Donald Tusk suggested as much Tuesday. “Dear America, appreciate your allies. After all, you don’t have that many,\" he said in Brussels ahead of Trump's visit. \"We do have a lot of allies, but we cannot be taken advantage of,\" Trump responded. \"We're being taken advantage of by the European Union.\" Trump has tied the issue of defense spending to his larger trade wars, saying the United States should not be subsidizing nations with which it runs a trade deficit. \"The European Union makes it impossible for our farmers and workers and companies to do business in Europe (U.S. has a $151 Billion trade deficit), and then they want us to happily defend them through NATO, and nicely pay for it,\" Trump tweeted. \"Just doesn’t work!\" One particular target of Trump's displeasure has been German Chancellor Angela Merkel. \"Germany pays 1 percent. One percent,\" Trump said at a campaign rally last week. \"And I said, you know, Angela, I can't guarantee it, but we're protecting you, and it means a lot more to you than protecting us because I don't know how much protection we get by protecting you.\" Germany's actual spending is 1.24 percent of its gross domestic product. But experts say Trump's focus on the percentage of defense spending only captures one dimension of an ally's contribution. Germany's government, for example, approved an increase in troops to serve in Afghanistan, to 1,300. And other countries include military pensions in its totals, which is effectively spending on past defense. Trump's excessive fixation on defense spending ignores those contributions, argues Jeffrey Rathke, the co-author of a recent study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies on NATO burden sharing. He also said the NATO figures don't take into account civilian spending that helps boost defense, like diplomatic efforts and training of local defense forces. Trump's frequent complaints about defense spending also obscure the fact that European defense spending is going up — even by Trump's own measure. Nineteen of the 29 members spend more on defense than they did in 2014, and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said half are on pace to meet the target by 2024. There are a lot of reasons for that: New threats from Russia following its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, an improving European economy, and U.S. pressure under both President Barack Obama and, more pointedly, Trump. \"Trump can claim some credit for the increase,\" said Daalder, Obama's NATO ambassador. \"The allies are certainly willing to give it to him if he were to recommit fully to NATO and collective defense.\" Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2L2iW0y.

Already beleaguered by Israel’s decade-old blockade of the strip, Gazans were made to suffer even more last year when the Palestinian Authority, run by Fatah, imposed harsh new restrictions in a power struggle with Hamas, its archrival. An attempt at reconciliation between the two last fall has since bogged down, and a standoff over salaries and revenue has sent the territory’s economy into free-fall, with many expecting a war with Israel as a result. Colonel Conricus said the Israeli soldiers, whose injuries were not life-threatening, were hurt as they inspected a Palestinian flag that had been placed along the Gaza-Israel fence Friday morning amid a chaotic riot of hundreds of protesters, who were throwing rocks and trying to tear down the fence — and who were also obscured from view by a morning fog. He said the episode showed that Israel was right to treat protests at the Gaza fence as a military threat. “We’ve been speaking about these staged riots for a long time,” Colonel Conricus said. “When Hamas organizes these riots and pushes people towards the fence, what we’re saying is, this isn’t a peaceful demonstration, these people aren’t unarmed, they’re rioters — and among the rioters are actual terrorist operatives who have other things in mind.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Netanyahu, who wished the wounded soldiers a speedy recovery from Munich, where he was attending a security conference, also responded angrily to remarks by the prime minister of Poland, Mateusz Morawiecki, after he stirred new controversy in defending a Polish law that criminalizes references to Nazi killing sites during the Holocaust as “Polish death camps.” Asked by an Israeli journalist, Ronen Bergman, if it would violate the new law for him to discuss how his Jewish parents had only escaped from Poland because they learned that their neighbors were about to inform on them to the Nazis, Mr. Morawiecki said that “of course” it was “not going to be seen as criminal to say that there were Polish perpetrators, as there were Jewish perpetrators, as there were Russian perpetrators, as there were Ukrainian,” in addition to Germans.

CLOSE Voices from the protest outside Archdiocese of Covington in Kentucky on Jan 22, 2019. Cincinnati Enquirer The nationwide firestorm surrounding Covington Catholic has brought to light that one of the Greater Cincinnati high school's most prominent graduates happens to be President Trump's top White House attorney. Pat Cipollone, CovCath class of 1984, recently took over as White House general counsel. He had previously served as an informal adviser to the president on the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections. What does Cipollone's White House role have to do with last week's incident in Washington, D.C., involving current CovCath students? Absolutely nothing, but it wasn't been widely known that Trump had a top adviser directly connected to CovCath – or to Greater Cincinnati, for that matter. White House general counsel Pat Cipollone is a 1984 graduate of Covington Catholic High School. (Photo: Provided/Stein Mitchell Beato & Missner LLP) Several attempts to interview Cipollone on Tuesday were unsuccessful. A woman at Cipollone's suburban Washington, D.C., home told The Enquirer he was not available for comment. Trump took to Twitter on Monday night and again Tuesday morning to defend the CovCath students, embroiled in a controversy for their behavior during other groups' protests and marches last week near the Lincoln Memorial. It's unknown whether Cipollone advised the president to weigh in. More: White House 'reached out' to Covington Catholic students to offer support More: Analysis: Breaking down the full video with Covington Catholic students Cipollone, 52, has spent most of his nearly 30-year career in Washington and Chicago. Not much is publicly known about him back home in Greater Cincinnati. In extensive Google and Enquirer archives searches, in fact, one of the few news items that showed Cipollone's connection to the region was a blurb about his hiring in the Trump administration buried on page 26 in last month's Covington Catholic Journal school magazine. Here are some other things to know about Cipollone: • He's a committed Catholic advocate. In 2004, Cipollone was one of the founding members of the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast. Conservative former presidential candidate Rick Santorium also helped start the annual prayer meeting, which draws more than 1,500 people to Washington. • Cipollone is \"well-liked and respected\" by Trump's personal attorneys, the Washington Post reported in October, when Cipollone was hired. In the same article, Trump was quoted as saying: \"Pat's a great guy. He's very talented.\" • Fox News' Laura Ingraham has called Cipollone her \"godfather\" and \"spiritual mentor\" because he helped the conservative commentator convert to Catholicism in 2002, according to The Post. • After leaving CovCath, Cipollone received his bachelor's degree from New York City's Fordham University.

{"global_context": "An admirer of Dylann Roof who bought a gun from the FBI said he wanted to do something on a \"f**king big scale.\". WASHINGTON ― A South Carolina white supremacist who praised racist mass shooter Dylann Roof and longed to commit violence against Jews, Muslims and people of color has reached a plea deal with federal prosecutors that will likely result in a relatively short stint in federal prison. Benjamin Thomas Samuel McDowell, a 30-year-old from Conway, South Carolina, was arrested in an FBI sting in February 2017 after he purchased a disabled weapon from an undercover FBI agent who McDowell believed was a member of a white supremacist organization. The feds said McDowell, who has white supremacist tattoos, believed white supremacists needed to turn their talk into action, and that he expressed a desire to “do something on a fucking big scale.” As part of a deal with federal prosecutors, McDowell pleaded guilty last week to a single count of being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition. While the charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years, McDowell’s sentencing range will be between 10 months and just over three years. The plea agreement isn’t binding, so the judge could potentially give him a lengthier sentence. But as part of the deal, McDowell has the right to appeal if he’s sentenced to more than three years and one month behind bars. Mental health issues played a role in McDowell’s case. A mental health evaluation ordered by U.S. District Judge R. Bryan Harwell was filed under seal in December, and McDowell and his federal public defender said McDowell was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder. McDowell’s “cognitive functioning is very low” and his intellectual ability is “significantly below average,” according to a prior court filing, which indicated he’d received disability benefits until he was 18 because he was classified as mentally disabled. But McDowell’s case still illustrates the differences in how the federal government approaches domestic terrorism investigations compared with investigations that involve foreign terrorist organizations. Had McDowell taken the same actions but been inspired by a group like the self-described Islamic State, rather than by white supremacists, he’d likely be facing a much different future, mental health issues or no. McDowell came to the FBI’s attention the same way a lot of federal terrorism defendants do: through social media. McDowell, who had a felony conviction and evidently came into contact with white supremacists when he served time in prison, posted a number of troubling screeds on Facebook. In late 2016 he posted a link to the website of a synagogue in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and said he would “love to act.” In early 2017, he posted on Facebook that Dylann Roof ― the white supremacist mass murderer who killed nine African-American churchgoers in Charleston in 2015 ― did what white supremacists were supposed to do. An undercover FBI agent posing as a member of the Aryan Nations soon met with McDowell, who said he was frustrated that white supremacists were too busy screaming about white power to get the job done. “I got the heart to do that shit, but I don’t have the good training,” McDowell allegedly said. “I seen what Dylann Roof did and in my heart I reckon I got a little bit of hatred and I... I want to do that shit. Like, I got desire... not for nobody else... it just... I want something where I can say, ‘I fucking did that’... me personally... If I could do something on a fucking big scale and write on the fucking building or whatever, ‘In the spirit of Dylann Roof.’” McDowell is similar to some defendants caught in FBI terrorism stings in that he may not have had the means or ability to carry out a plot on his own. McDowell, who did some landscaping work and had worked as a janitor at Horry County’s courthouse, ran into logistical problems when he was the target of the FBI sting: His mother would not allow him use her cellphone, and he had to borrow cash from his grandfather to buy the weapon from the FBI for just $109. McDowell’s inability to plan an actual attack may, in the end, have been to his advantage. In court, according to a transcript obtained by HuffPost, a federal prosecutor said there was “no indication” that McDowell had a “particular target” or “particular plan.” The prosecutor said McDowell had “specifically requested hollow point .40-caliber ammunition,” and that he agreed to purchase a .40-caliber Glock and ammunition. Bill Nettles, McDowell’s federal public defender, told the court that while his client admitted to the possession offense, there were “no overt acts, no planning, no plotting, no casing of any location.” But the handling of his case is different, in part because of the way the law is written. The United States doesn’t have a criminal statute that makes domestic terrorism illegal writ large. If McDowell had been planning an attack on behalf of ISIS or another designated terrorist organization, he’d also be facing a material support charge in addition to the weapons charge. But he’s not facing any terrorism-related charge ― just a felon in possession of a firearm charge that is commonly deployed against defendants. McDowell’s mental health issues likely affected his plea deal. But by and large, raising mental health issues hasn’t worked for many Muslim defendants facing federal terrorism charges. There are a few exceptions: Adel Daoud, an 18-year-old arrested in an FBI sting in Chicago in 2012, still hasn’t been tried, because a judge ruled that his belief in “lizard people” and his “pervasive belief that the Court and the prosecution are members of the Illuminati and that his attorneys are Freemasons” significantly undermined his rational understanding of the court proceedings. Daoud, who has been housed at the Bureau of Prisons’ federal medical center in North Carolina, has another competency hearing scheduled this month. Mike German, a former FBI agent now with the Brennan Center for Justice, said the issue isn’t necessarily that white defendants are treated too gently, but that the fearmongering about radical Islamic terrorism has made it impossible for anyone to consider the actual circumstances in cases involving Muslim defendants. “There has been such an effort to drum up fear of Muslim terrorism that it’s hard for these authorities to look at a Muslim person charged with terrorism the same way they would look at a white person,” German told HuffPost. “It’s a whole-of-society issue, not just an FBI issue,” he said. “Because judges and juries are susceptible to the fearmongering regarding Muslim terrorism, it’s hard for them to make objective decisions about the threat these people actually pose.” German says judges and juries are more willing to hear out complaints about government conduct in cases that don’t involve Muslim defendants accused of terrorism. Members of the Christian Hutaree militia, for example, had their most serious charges dismissed by a federal judge who rebuked the government for its conduct in the sting case. “You don’t see that kind of analysis by judges in cases where there are Muslim subjects,” German said. “Quite the opposite ― you have the Newburgh sting case, where a judge acknowledged that only the government could’ve turned the main defendant into a terrorist because he was such a buffoon, and yet found him guilty and sentenced him to 25 years in prison.” The judge in that sting case, which involved defendants from Newburgh, New York, said she believed “beyond a shadow of a doubt that there would have been no crime here except the government instigated it, planned it and brought it to fruition.” German said he believes that in the terrorism realm, the government goes after individuals who they know have mental health issues. “You look at the cases where people who don’t have two nickels to rub together are given military-grade explosives and Stinger missiles and provided with room and shelter while the nascent plot is being driven,” German said. As for McDowell, his guilty plea last Monday received little attention in a busy news week. The U.S. Attorney’s Office put out a statement two days after McDowell’s guilty plea, but the development received no national Justice Department press release, as it likely would have if McDowell had been facing terrorism charges. A federal prosecutor said the U.S. Attorney’s Office could revisit HuffPost’s questions about the case after McDowell’s sentencing, which hasn’t been scheduled.

{"global_context": "Trump described Kanye West as a “very different kind of guy” and praised him as a “genius” who can help him usher in prison reform. Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. President Donald Trump on Thursday described Kanye West as a “very different kind of guy” and praised him as a “genius” who can help him usher in prison reform ahead of a planned White House lunch with the famous rapper later in the day. In a wide-ranging, 45-minute phone interview with Fox News' \"Fox & Friends,\" Trump said he had “a lot of African-American support” and that “a lot has developed over the last little while with Kanye coming out.” “I like him a lot, he’s a friend of mine,” Trump said of West, who is scheduled to meet Thursday with Trump, Jared Kushner and former NFL star Jim Brown at the White House to discuss prison reform, gang violence prevention and other topics. “He's a very different kind of a guy, I say that in a positive way,” Trump added. “Those in the music business say he’s a genius, and that’s okay with me.” West has repeatedly expressed support for the president, drawing backlash as a result. West has said that he didn't vote in 2016, but if he had, he would have voted for Trump, and he met with Trump during his presidential transition. And in May, Trump met with West's wife, Kim Kardashian West, about criminal sentencing reform. During the meeting, Kardashian West pushed Trump to commute the sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, a first-time offender who was sentenced to life in prison in 1996 for her involvement in a drug conspiracy. The president commuted her sentence in June. Trump said Thursday that he wanted to push broader prison reform and that if his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, was opposed to it, he would “get overruled by me because I make the decisions.” Trump has repeatedly criticized Sessions in recent months, and rumors have swirled that the beleaguered cabinet official will be fired after the November midterm elections. The Washington Post reported Wednesday that Trump talked recently with Sessions’s own chief of staff, Matthew Whitaker, about replacing Sessions as attorney general. In his interview Thursday with “Fox and Friends,” Trump praised Whitaker as a “great guy” but declined to talk about any “conversations that I had.” He said he was “not doing anything” when it came to Sessions and that “I want to get the elections over with\" and \"we'll see what happens.\" Trump touched on a multitude of other topics during the interview, including a response to comments made by his wife, first lady Melania Trump, that there were people working in the White House whom she didn’t trust. Melania Trump, in a previously taped interview with ABC’s “Good Morning America” that aired Thursday morning, replied, “yes,” when asked if her husband “had people that you didn't trust working for him.” “I let him know,” she said. “Some people, they don't work there anymore and it's very difficult sometimes because I'm so busy with my office, I don't get involved with the West Wing.” Melania Trump — who also said during the interview that she felt she was “the most bullied person in the world” — added that there were still people inside the White House that her husband can’t trust. Asked about his wife’s remarks, the president suggested such a situation was “more true” when he first moved to Washington. “I think it was more true,” he said. “I didn’t know people in Washington.” \"Now I know everybody,\" he continued, adding that, “I know some that I wish I didn't know but I know a lot of people.\".

{"global_context": "Former Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone settled a defamation suit for publishing false and misleading statements on InfoWars.com. Mr. Stone’s admission comes amid intensifying scrutiny of his credibility. As questions swirl about his credibility, former Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone settled a defamation suit seeking $100 million in damages on Monday for publishing false and misleading statements on InfoWars.com, a far-right website known for promoting conspiracy theories. The agreement requires Mr. Stone to run ads in national newspapers, including The Wall Street Journal, apologizing for making defamatory statements about a Chinese businessman who is a vocal critic of Beijing. It also requires Mr. Stone to publish a retraction of the false statements on social media. Doing so exempts him from paying any of the damages. In a text message, Mr. Stone described his conduct as “irresponsible” and added that “I am solely responsible for fulfilling the terms of the settlement.” Unrelated to the Russia probe, Mr. Stone’s, settlement is the latest indication that Mr. Stone’s use of various media platforms to spread unfounded claims isn’t without consequences. Special counsel Robert Mueller’s office is investigating Mr. Stone’s role in orchestrating stories about key events being examined in the Russia probe, the Journal has reported. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), who is expected to take control of the House Intelligence Committee, said on Sunday of Mr. Stone’s testimony last year: “I believe there’s ample reason to be concerned about his truthfulness.” Mr. Stone has accused Mr. Schiff of “smear tactics” and said he stands by his testimony. The settlement resulted from a lawsuit filed in Florida federal court in March by exiled Chinese businessman Guo Wengui. Mr. Guo sued Mr. Stone for falsely accusing him of being a “turncoat criminal who is convicted of crimes here and in China.” Mr. Stone also accused him of violating U.S. election laws by making political donations to Hillary Clinton, according to the lawsuit. It is illegal for foreign nationals to donate to U.S. election campaigns. Mr. Stone did not respond to a question about how the settlement impacts him financially. In recent weeks, Mr. Stone has publicly complained of his mounting legal bills, which are likely to soar higher as he continues to be of interest to investigators probing Russian interference in the 2016 election. “This threatens to bankrupt my family and destroy me financially,” Mr. Stone said of the Russia probes on an InfoWars broadcast earlier this month. He asked for financial support and said his bills already exceed half a million dollars. Mr. Stone has repeatedly claimed that prosecutors will have to go through him to get to President Trump, and that he will never testify against the president, whom he has known for decades. He has criticized the investigators on social media, calling the special counsel’s probe a witch hunt run by “Deep State hit man Robert Mueller” and his “minions.” A spokesman for the special counsel’s office declined to comment. Mr. Trump has denied colluding with Russia, and Moscow has denied interfering in the U.S. election. Mr. Stone has denied wrongdoing. Earlier this month, Mr. Trump praised Mr. Stone’s “guts” and credibility, tweeting that Mr. Stone wouldn’t “make up lies and stories” by testifying in Mr. Mueller’s probe. At the time, Mr. Stone’s lawyers were already negotiating his settlement with Mr. Guo. Mr. Guo drew scrutiny from Beijing in 2017 after he launched a high-stakes social media campaign alleging wrongdoing and corruption by China’s political and business elites. Beijing declared Mr. Guo a criminal suspect and requested an Interpol arrest notice against him, while Mr. Guo applied for asylum in the U.S., making him a flashpoint in China-U.S. relations. Mr. Guo became a target of Mr. Stone’s a few months after launching his campaign, according to the lawsuit. In an interview last month Mr. Guo claimed that Mr. Stone was paid to make the defamatory remarks about him on InfoWars. He said the payment ultimately came from a Chinese-American media tycoon named Bruno Wu, whom Mr. Guo previously accused of being a spy for the Chinese government. Mr. Wu has filed a defamation lawsuit against Mr. Guo for these and other claims. Mr. Stone’s settlement identifies Mr. Wu as “the apparent source of the information” about Mr. Guo and says it was conveyed to him by a former member of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. Mr. Stone said he should not have relied on the former staffer, Sam Nunberg, for the information. Both Mr. Nunberg and Mr. Wu declined to comment.

(Photo: Brynn Anderson, AP) WASHINGTON – Alabama Republican Roy Moore says a lawsuit will be filed over the newspaper report carrying allegations that he had sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl four decades ago and that neither Democrats nor Republicans want to see him win a special Senate election. While pressure to quit the race four weeks before Election Day intensified from within the Republican Party, Moore assured supporters Sunday night at a Huntsville, Alabama, gym that the Washington Post story was “fake news” and “a desperate attempt to stop my political campaign.” Moore said allegations that he was involved with a minor child are “untrue” and said the newspaper “will be sued,” drawing a round of applause. The former judge also questioned why such allegations would be leveled for the first time so close to the special election in spite of his decades in public life. “Why would they come now? Because there are groups that don’t want me in the United States Senate,” he said, naming the Democratic Party and the Republican establishment and accusing them of working together. He added, “We do not plan to let anybody deter us from this race.” The Post story quoted four women by name, including the woman who alleged the sexual contact at 14, and had two dozen other sources. Roy Moore greets supporters at an election-night rally after declaring victory on Sept. 26, 2017, in Montgomery, Ala. (Photo: Scott Olson, Getty Images) Moore also tried to raise money from the controversy, writing in a fundraising pitch sent about midafternoon that the “vicious and sleazy attacks against me are growing more vicious by the minute.” He told supporters, “I’m counting on you to stand with me at this critical moment by chipping in a donation to help me bust through the vicious lies and attacks and get the truth out to as many voters as possible before December 12.” Another fellow Republican, Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, urged Moore to drop out of the race. He said Moore’s explanations had been inadequate and that Republicans should consider Sen. Luther Strange as a write-in candidate to run against Moore. Strange lost the Republican primary to Moore in September. Even if Moore were to step aside, his name would likely remain on the ballot. And any effort to add Strange as a write-in candidate would threaten to divide the GOP vote in a way that would give the Democratic candidate a greater chance of winning. Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey told NBC’s Meet the Press that Roy Moore should “step aside.\" Toomey did not rule out the possibility that Senate Republicans might work to unseat Moore if he wins the special election against Democrat Doug Jones. “You know, this is a terrible situation, nearly 40-year-old allegation, we’ll probably never know for sure exactly what happened,” Toomey said on “Meet the Press” on NBC. “But from my point of view, I think the accusations have more credibility than the denial. I think it would be best if Roy would just step aside.” The White House, pointedly noting that President Donald Trump did not back Moore during the primary, said Trump will likely weigh in on the Senate race when he returns from Asia later this week. The White House has already made clear that Moore should step aside if the allegations are proven to be true. “I think there’s a special place in hell for those who actually perpetrate these crimes,” White House legislative aide Marc Short said Sunday. “But, having said that, he hasn’t been proved guilty,” Short added. “We have to afford him the chance to defend himself.” Moore is an outspoken Christian conservative and former state Supreme Court judge. The Post reported last Thursday that he had sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl and pursued three other teenagers decades earlier. While he called the allegations “completely false and misleading,” in an interview with conservative radio host Sean Hannity he did not wholly rule out dating teenage girls when he was in his early 30s. Asked if that would have been usual for him, Moore said, “Not generally, no.” Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Several companies have pulled their advertisements from Fox News host Sean Hannity's show following his interview with Alabama Republican senate candidate Roy Moore on Friday. USA TODAY The story stirred concern among anxious GOP officials in Washington in a key race to fill the Senate seat once held by Jeff Sessions, now the U.S. attorney general. Losing the special election to a Democrat would imperil Republicans’ already slim 52-48 majority in the Senate, which is hoping to pass a tax overhaul later this year. But a Moore victory also would pose risks if he were to join the Senate GOP with a cloud of sexual misconduct allegations. In the immediate aftermath of the Post report, a wave of national Republican leaders called for Moore to drop out of the race if the allegations are true. They included the head of the House Freedom Caucus, Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.

{"global_context": "Democrats are eager to press acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, during his first testimony to Congress, on his interactions with President Donald Trump and his oversight of the special counsel's Russia investigation. Whitaker's highly anticipated testimony Friday had been in limbo after the Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee approved a tentative subpoena to ensure that he appeared and answered questions. Whitaker responded by saying that he would not come unless the committee dropped its subpoena threat, which he called an act of \"political theater.\" The stalemate ended Thursday evening after the committee chairman, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said the committee would not issue a subpoena if Whitaker appeared voluntarily. \"In light of that commitment,\" department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement, Whitaker looked forward to come to Capitol Hill and discussing \"the great work\" carried out by the department. Whitaker is likely in his final days as the country's chief law enforcement officer because the Senate plans to vote soon on confirming William Barr, Trump's pick for attorney general. Democrats who perceive Whitaker as a Trump loyalist were expected to ask him whether he has made any commitments to the president about Robert Mueller's Russia investigation and whether he has shared with Trump any inside information. Also expected to come up was Whitaker's comment last week that he believed the investigation into potential ties between Russia and the Trump campaign was nearly done.

{"global_context": "President Trump’s assertion belied a long record of meetings his predecessor, Barack Obama, held with the families of killed service members, as well as calls and letters. “This is an outrageous and disrespectful lie even by Trump standards,” Benjamin J. Rhodes, a former deputy national security adviser to Mr. Obama, posted on Twitter. “Also,” Mr. Rhodes added, “Obama never attacked a Gold Star family.” That reference was to the public feud Mr. Trump began with the parents of a Muslim American soldier, Humayun Khan, who was killed in Iraq in 2004. The soldier’s parents, Khizr and Ghazala Khan, appeared at the Democratic National Convention in 2016, where Mr. Khan criticized Mr. Trump. Alyssa Mastromonaco, a former senior aide to Mr. Obama, used even stronger language on Twitter, calling Mr. Trump’s statement a lie — along with an expletive — and describing him as a “deranged animal.” A spokesman for Mr. Obama declined to comment. Several former Obama administration officials recalled the former president’s walks through Section 60 at Arlington National Cemetery, where the dead from Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, his visits to the wounded at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, and the time he spent with families of the fallen at the White House and around the country. In August 2011, after a Chinook military helicopter was shot down over Afghanistan, killing 38 people, including 25 Special Forces troops, Mr. Obama consoled the families of all those killed, according to Jeremy B. Bash, a former chief of staff to Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta, who attended the ceremony. Video David Axelrod, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama, said, “I don’t recall anything moving him more. He saw it as his duty to console them as best he could and thank them on behalf of the nation.” But several officials said it was not always realistic to expect presidents to call the families of every fallen soldier. During the peak years of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Mr. Obama and former President George W. Bush faced hundreds of fatalities each year. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In 2009, the first year of Mr. Obama’s presidency, there were 317 American military fatalities in Afghanistan and 149 in Iraq. So far this year, there have been 11 fatalities in Afghanistan and 14 in Iraq. Seventeen sailors were killed in accidents involving two Navy warships, the John S. McCain and the Fitzgerald.

The body of a fourth American soldier was recovered later. While he did not explain why he had not called their families, Mr. Trump said he had written letters to the family members over the weekend, which he said would be mailed later in the day or on Tuesday. He said he also planned to call them. “I felt very, very badly about that,” he said. “The toughest calls I have to make are the calls where this happens. Soldiers are killed. It’s a very difficult thing,” he said. “Now, it gets to a point where, you know, you make four or five of them in one day. It’s a very, very tough day. For me, that’s by far the toughest.” A senior official said Mr. Trump had planned to speak sooner to the families, but the White House had to wait until the Pentagon’s paperwork was completed. Pentagon officials said the military’s Africa Command was putting together a detailed timeline of the attack and of the response by French helicopters that first provided air cover for the badly outnumbered American and Nigerian forces, and eventually medical evacuation. On Monday, Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, joined a growing chorus calling for a review of the circumstances leading to the ambush. After he answered the question about his response to the attack, Mr. Trump was pressed later in the news conference about his claim that Mr. Obama had never called bereaved families. This time, he seemed to soften his tone. “I don’t know if he did,” the president said. “I was told he didn’t often, and a lot of presidents don’t. They write letters.” “President Obama, I think, probably did sometimes and maybe sometimes he didn’t,” Mr. Trump continued. “That’s what I was told. All I can do is ask my generals.”.

{"global_context": "Florida's contentious and expensive campaign between Democrat Bill Nelson and Republican Rick Scott could decide which party controls the Senate. CLOSE It looks like younger voters are going to be one of the key deciding factors in this years midterm elections. Veuer's Nick Cardona breaks down the latest polling data. Buzz60 Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., left, and Florida Gov. Rick Scott (Photo: EPA-EFE, AP) WASHINGTON – After millions of dollars, thousands of TV ads and scores of bruising personal attacks, Florida’s nationally watched Senate race between Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson and GOP Gov. Rick Scott is right where it started months ago: a virtual toss-up. When Scott formally kicked off the race in April by announcing he would challenge Nelson, the contest was already being shaped by three forces: the shadow of President Donald Trump on the state following his election in 2016, the arrival of thousands of Puerto Ricans to Florida following Hurricane Maria's devastation last year, and the Parkland gun massacre at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in February. Those factors remain in play, but others are crowding the agenda, including the state’s red tide crisis, the impact of Hurricane Michael and a gubernatorial race at the top of the state ticket that features fierce partisans who have energized their bases. How those issues will pan out in a state known for close elections is up for debate. But most predict — what else? — another whisker-thin outcome Tuesday in a race with what could be the highest turnout for a midterm election since 1994. Hello! We’ve got complete midterm election coverage right here. Let’s begin! “It’s Florida,” said Ron Pierce, a Tampa-based Republican lobbyist. “We’re such a diverse state and any time there an ultra-competitive race like this, I think you’re going to continue to see very close races. This is nothing new.” Senate control at stake Most polls consistently show Nelson with a slight lead but usually within the margin of error. While it is playing the undercard to the gubernatorial main event between Republican Ron DeSantis and Democrat Andrew Gillum, the matchup between Scott and Nelson has national implications. Republicans control 51 of the chamber’s 100 seats so Democrats need a net gain of two seats to recapture the chamber and holding Nelson’s seat is considered crucial. Florida is one of 10 Senate seats – four held by Republicans, six by Democrats – that are considered among the nation’s most competitive, according to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. The party that controls the Senate not only will be able to steer the legislative agenda on Capitol Hill but decide the future of Trump’s executive branch and judicial nominees. If another opening occurs on the Supreme Court, senators will be able to confirm or reject the president’s nominee by a simple majority. High turnout Florida voters are already showing up in large numbers in early and absentee voting. Turnout for the primary election in August was 27 percent, nine points higher than 2014 and the highest midterm turnout since 2002. Experts say early voting indicators suggest turnout Tuesday should match — if not eclipse — the 55 percent level in 2002. Turnout in the 2014 midterm was 51 percent. As of Friday morning, more than 4 million of the state’s roughly 13 million voters have cast ballots, according to state records. Another 1.3 million ballots have been requested but not returned. So far, Republicans have a slight edge among those who have voted already. Experts say it's not clear which candidate is helped by high turnout because the party faithful on both sides is deeply engaged. Democrats generally do well when turnout increases given their traditional constituencies — college-aged, minority and low-income voters. They tend not to vote during midterm elections. But Trump is bringing in blue-collar voters for Scott who normally sit out the mid-terms while the 39-year-old Gillum, vying to be only the third elected black governor in U.S. history, is attracting young and minority voters, said Susan MacManus, a retired political science professor at the University of South Florida. \"He brings a new face, a younger person, racial diversity, connects stronger with those more liberal on economic and social issues,\" she said. Sen. Bill Nelson and Gov. Rick Scott shake hands at the first Senate debate in Miramar, FL on Tuesday. (Photo: Ivan Apfel for NBCUniversal/Telemundo) Democratic consultant Steve Schale, who directed the winning 2008 Obama/Biden campaign in Florida, said one troubling trend for Nelson is low early voter turnout among Hispanics, who comprise 16 percent of all voters. “It feels pretty Cuban right now,” he said referring to hundreds of thousands of Cubans in Miami who lean heavily to Republicans. What's potentially worrisome, he said, is that more progressive Hispanics in other parts of the state that could boost Nelson, notably Puerto Ricans in the Orlando area, have yet to turn out in high numbers. Trump factor Democrats have done their best to tie Scott to Trump — and there's plenty of material. Scott was one of the first prominent Republican politicians in the nation to embrace Trump’s candidacy in 2016. The Florida governor raised money for the New York mogul, hosted an inaugural party after he won and frequented the White House last year to see his buddy. He also ran the New Republican Super PAC, the pro-Trump committee that raised money for the presidential campaign in 2016. Since he started running for the Senate, Scott has toned down his relationship with the president especially given Trump's attacks on Hispanics and crackdown on immigration. About one in six voters in the Sunshine state is Hispanic. President Trump and Florida Gov. Rick Scott, left, visit Lynn Haven, Fla. (Photo: RICARDO ROLON, The News-Press via USA TODAY Network) A Spanish-language ad Scott released in September sought to distance himself from the president. “When I don’t agree with what President Trump does or says, I’ve said it,” Scott begins in Spanish. “My only commitment is with you.” But moving away from Trump, who stumped for Scott and other Republicans Wednesday, has its downside too. Polls suggest he enjoys relatively decent approval numbers and he won the state, albeit narrowly, two years ago in a presidential campaign where he bested two of Florida's favorite GOP sons: Former Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio. More: Challenge for Florida Sen. Bill Nelson: Winning votes in 'Trump' counties More: Florida Gov. Rick Scott: 10 notable legacies of the Republican during eight years in office More: Sen. Bill Nelson and Donald Trump: 10 key votes the Florida Democrat cast in the Trump era Each facing their toughest race In Scott, Nelson, 76, faces his toughest Senate opponent yet: a well-known, two-term governor who spent more than $80 million of his own fortune to win two gubernatorial elections. The governor already has given his campaign $51 million to defeat Nelson, as of Oct. 17, and he's expected to open his wallet more in the final days of the campaign. Through Oct. 17, both have spent a combined $92 million, with Scott doling out about $7 to Nelson’s $3, according to Federal Election Commission records. In addition, outside groups have spent more than $10 million helping Scott and more than $11 million helping Nelson, according to FEC records. Scott's approval numbers among Florida voters have been steadily rising. Though only in the mid-40s in many polls, they stand among the highest of his eight-year tenure as governor. In Nelson, Scott, 65, faces a rival who has won five straight statewide elections, including the last three for senator. And while Scott never won 50 percent in either gubernatorial race, Nelson won his last re-election decisively by 13 percentage points. In addition, he's crafted an image as a political centrist despite an increasingly partisan Congress and a number of high-profile votes with his party in recent years approving the Affordable Care Act, opposing the Trump tax bill and voting last month against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Known commodities The attacks from both candidates against the other have been relentless and sharp. Almost all of those broadsides have been launched on television and digital ads that were echoed in the one debate they held last month. Nelson is portrayed as a do-nothing lackey of the Democratic machine who has little to show for his decades in public office and who skipped multiple floor votes this fall instead of representing his constituents on Capitol Hill.

(Bob Self/Florida Times-Union via AP) ORG XMIT: FLJAJ101 (Photo: Bob Self, AP) \"He's been there 42 years\" and has gotten nothing done, Scott said during the debate broadcast by Telemundo 51/WSCV, a Spanish-language TV station in Miami. Scott is painted as a partisan, self-serving politician whose decisions as governor to reject Medicaid expansion and curb environmental regulations that critics say have contributed to massive algae blooms make him unfit for the Senate. “He has systematically, in his eight years as governor, systematically disassembled the environmental agencies of this state,” Nelson said during the same debate Given that both Nelson and Scott are well-known to most of the state's mid-term voters, it's difficult to see how those attacks matter on any large scale, Schale said. \"You have two people who are pretty well defined, have pretty solid bases of their own and there's not a lot of new information.\" he said. Buffeted by Hurricanes Three major storms in the last 14 months have inflicted their own impact on the Senate race in different ways. Hurricanes Irma and Maria (2017), and Michael (last month) gave Scott a chance to flex his executive skills leading the state through crises. Before and after Irma and Michael struck Florida, Scott’s was a constant presence on television warning people to evacuate and assuring them that recovery would be robust when it was over. Polls suggested he earned high marks for his performance. Maria struck Puerto Rico but Scott’s frequent visits to the battered island, his outreach to families who decided to relocate to Florida and his visible sympathy for victims — striking a sharp contrast in tone to Trump — won him kudos among those in the Hispanic community. But the hurricanes also could hurt Scott, analysts say. Maria brought the prospect of more moderate and liberal Puerto Ricans to the state voters rolls who, despite their general approval of the governor, might not want to help Trump by helping the Senate seat go Republican. And Michael struck eight counties in reliably red North Florida (roughly 1.9 percent of the state’s registered voters, according to Schale), disrupting not just lives but people’s willingness and ability to cast a ballot. Analysts say it could deny Scott at least several thousand votes, not an insignificant amount in a contest projected to be decided by a scant margin. ”They’re trying to put their lives back together, let alone who to vote for or not vote for,” said Pierce, the Republican consultant. “If you’re in an election that’s going to come down to a few thousand votes, any little thing could impact the outcome.\" A push to the finish line Following the gameplan that twice propelled him to the governor’s mansion, Scott is launching one last TV blitz around the state as he makes his closing argument. Nelson and his allies have committed a $2.3 million ad buy in the last few days of the campaign, according to data compiled exclusively for the USA TODAY Network by Kantar Media's Campaign Media Analysis Group. MacManus, the retired USF professor, said ads aren't going to decide the winner. It's which side can best relate to a changing state electorate that, at least for the 2018 election, is younger, more racially diverse and includes more women. \"The 2018 electorate is not like the 2014 [one],” she said. Ultimately, it will come down to how Florida voters view the president, said Schale, the Democratic strategist. \"What elected Scott twice was the electorate solidifying as an anti-Obama electorate in 2010 and 2014,\" he said referring to the years Scott won the gubernatorial race. \"If the late deciders choose to vote against Trump, then Nelson’s probably going to win.\" Contributing: John McCarthy, Florida Today Read or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/02/florida-senate-race-bill-nelson-rick-scott-trade-last-minute-punches/1823486002/.

Image copyright Mark Avellino Photography Hakeem Al-Araibi fears he will be tortured in Bahrain A Bahraini footballer is facing extradition from Thailand, despite international calls for his release. Hakeem Al-Araibi, 25, who holds refugee status in Australia, was detained in Bangkok last month on an Interpol warrant put out by Bahrain. He was sentenced in Bahrain for vandalism but denies the charges. Australia, football's governing body Fifa and rights groups have condemned his arrest as there are fears for his safety if he is sent back to Bahrain. Mr Al-Araibi claims he will be tortured if extradited. The footballer fled to Australia in 2014 where he was granted political asylum last year and plays for Melbourne football club Pascoe Vale. He was on a holiday in Thailand when authorities detained him at a Bangkok airport on 27 November. On Tuesday he appeared at a Bangkok court where his detention was extended for 60 days. Why is he wanted? In 2014, Hakeem Al-Araibi was sentenced in absentia in Bahrain to 10 years in prison for vandalising a police station. His home country's embassy in Thailand said on Twitter the footballer was wanted \"for security cases\". The former member of Bahrain's national soccer team denies all allegations. \"If I am deported to Bahrain, don't forget me, and if once I'm there you hear me saying things, don't believe me,\" he wrote on Facebook last week. \"I know what will happen to me and I know I will be tortured to confess things that I have never done.\" Image copyright Mark Avellino Photography There's been a chorus of international support for the player Mr Al-Araibi told Human Rights Watch (HRW) that if sent back to Bahrain his life would be in danger and that he had already been tortured there following Arab Spring protests in 2012. He has been a vocal critic of Bahraini authorities and HRW says he is also targeted because of his brother's political activism. What is Australia doing? Australia says it is in high level diplomatic talks with Thailand, seeking the football player's safe return. Foreign Minister Marise Payne said her country was \"concerned by the ongoing detention of Mr Hakeem Al-Araibi and calls for his immediate return to Australia\". Australia's Football Federation and international governing body Fifa have both also called for his release. Melbourne club Pascoe Vale sent an open letter to the Thai prime minister asking for their player to be protected \"as a recognised refugee in Australia\". \"He should not be forcibly returned to Bahrain, a country from which he has escaped persecution and fears return,\" the letter urges. Supporters have also started a fundraiser to help Mr Al-Araibi. Human Rights Watch Asia director Brad Adams said Thailand needed to realise \"the grave dangers facing\" the football player if returned to Bahrain. London-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy warned that Thailand would breach international law if it was to extradite the football player. \"Extraditing registered refugees and returning them to territories where they would face a real risk of persecution, torture, or other ill-treatment violates Thailand's obligations under international law, including the UN Convention Against Torture,\" the rights group said in a statement.

Republican Sen. Susan Collins said Sunday that the sexual misconduct, harassment and assault allegations from more than a dozen women against President Donald Trump “remain very disturbing” as a wave of women continue to come forward with claims against powerful men.

Moore has denied the allegations against him and said he does not remember “dating any girl without the permission of her mother.\" Trump was quick to criticize Franken after news of the allegation, but has so far remained silent on Moore. Collins said that if voters elect Moore, she believes the Senate would have “no choice” but to seat him, but there could be an ethics investigation. \"I read his denials, I listened to his radio interview, and I did not find him to be credible,\" she said. \"As more and more allegations come forward, that adds to the weight of evidence against him.\" \"I hope that the good voters of Alabama decide not to send him to the United States Senate,\" she added.

{"global_context": "An Arizona congressman known for his hard-line views on immigration called on the U.S. Capitol Police to arrest any undocumented immigrants who attend President Trump's State of the Union address, after at least two dozen Democratic lawmakers said they would bring \"dreamers\" as guests to Tuesday night's speech. Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., asked the Capitol Police and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to \"consider checking identification . . . and arresting any illegal aliens in attendance\" as well as detaining anyone using \"fraudulent social security numbers and identification to pass through security.\" His tweets on the subject caused a wave of online outrage roughly seven hours before the speech was scheduled to begin. The young people protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program would not be affected by an ID check because they have social security numbers and legal work status, according to aides who helped organize their attendance. But some lawmakers might have invited immigrants without these documents to attend the speech, said the aides, who were granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the legal status of some guests. \"Of all the places where the Rule of Law needs to be enforced, it should be in the hallowed halls of Congress,\" Gosar wrote on Twitter. \"Any illegal aliens attempting to go through security, under any pretext of invitation or otherwise, should be arrested and deported.\" Democratic lawmakers, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., plan to bring DACA recipients to the speech as a way to highlight their cause. Congress is working to negotiate an immigration deal that would protect \"dreamers,\" children who were brought to the United States illegally or who overstayed their visas, after the Trump administration announced an end to the program in September. Pelosi, who will bring DACA recipient Melody Klingenfuss as a guest Tuesday night, said Tuesday afternoon that Trump will \"see the dignity, courage and patriotism of dozens of dreamers\" when he looks into the House gallery during his speech. Klingenfuss, a professional organizer with California Dream Network, was born in Guatemala and joined her mother in Los Angeles at age nine. She holds a bachelor's degree from California State University, Los Angeles and a Master's degree from the University of South California, according to a memo from Pelosi's office. Requests for comment from Pelosi and the Capitol Police were not immediately returned. With tensions running high ahead of Trump's speech, it was unclear what kinds of outbursts or demonstrations the evening might produce. It's considered gravely disrespectful for lawmakers to disrupt presidential addresses, but some - such as Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C., who yelled \"You lie!\" at President Obama in 2009 - have done it anyway. Pelosi told House Democrats Tuesday not to interrupt Trump and instead \"let the attention be on his slobbering self.\" She said that if Democrats want to protest, they should join the group that will not attend at all. \"If you want to walk out, don't come in,\" Pelosi told Democrats during a closed-door caucus meeting. The comments, first reported by Politico, were confirmed by a person familiar with the meeting. Pelosi also suggested Trump will benefit from low expectations. \"If his nose isn't running and he isn't burping, he did a great speech,\" she predicted. Pelosi also plans to bring Virginia Del. Elizabeth Guzman, who will deliver Democrats' Spanish-language response to the speech, as well as AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten and former Virginia Democratic governor Terry McAuliffe.

{"global_context": "California senator’s challenge to Biden on racial issues provided the night’s most dramatic moment. The second round of the first Democratic debate was set up to be an event dominated by the differences between former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) upstaged them both. Harris delivered a dominating performance through much of the two hours, attacking Biden on civil rights, showing passion on race and other issues and silencing her fellow candidates when their crosstalk early in the debate threatened to show Democrats as a squabbling and disagreeable family. It was when, as others talked about racial issues, that she broke in and changed the flow of the evening by reminding voters of the attributes that help define her candidacy. “As the only black person on this stage, I would like to speak on the issue of race,” she declared. Biden asserted that Harris’s criticisms on race were a “mischaracterization of my position across the board.” But her attacks, delivered at close range and with forcefulness and personal references, left a mark on the former vice president and established her as a candidate to be reckoned with. Harris has often struggled to match the promise of her candidacy, but in her first opportunity arrayed as one of 10 candidates, she made the most of the opportunities she was given — and took some on her own to announce her arrival on the big stage. Thursday’s debate may not change the polls much but it will probably reorder how Democrats begin to think about the choices before them. A camera operator works as Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) is shown on a screen during the second night of the first Democratic presidential campaign debate in Miami on Thursday. (Jayme Gershen/Bloomberg News) The differences between Biden and Sanders, which are real and unresolved, proved to be only a subtext of the Thursday debate. Instead it was other candidates who helped drive the debate and shape the tone. Sen. Michael F. Bennet (Colo.) came close to Harris at times, whether attacking Biden for cutting a deal that made permanent the tax cuts first passed during the presidency of George W. Bush or offering counterarguments to those candidates advocating a single-payer Medicare-for-all program that would eliminate private insurance. Biden was the focus of a series of criticisms by his rivals, but it was Harris who braced him most directly when she challenged him for his recent comments about working with two segregationist senators decades ago and for opposing school busing, noting that she was a beneficiary of busing policies. She also pointed to her differences with the Obama-Biden administration on the deportation of undocumented immigrants. Biden is an experienced debater and knew how and when to parry the attacks that kept coming at him. But Thursday’s debate underscored what many Democrats have said about this nominating contest, which is that, while Biden is the clear leader in the polls, he is not the kind of dominating candidate that others who have enjoyed the label of front-runner have proved to be. Hours before the debate, Biden campaign advisers said he would use the evening to talk about “really transformational change” by stressing his belief that he can end this period of hyper-partisanship and return the country to civility and consensus. But he rarely got the opportunity to make that case. Instead he spent the evening on the defensive. The bracing attack by Harris proved to be the most dramatic moment of either of the two nights of debating among the 20 candidates who qualified under Democratic National Committee rules to be on the stage in the Adrienne Arsht Center. Her opening came after South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg was asked about the racial turmoil in his city stemming from the recent killing of a black man by a white police officer . Buttigieg delivered a heartfelt answer to a pointed question about why the force was barely integrated in a city that is a quarter African American. “I could walk you through all of the things that we have done as a community, all of the steps that we took, from bias training to de-escalation, but it didn’t save the life of Eric Logan,” he said. “And when I look into his mother’s eyes, I have to face the fact that nothing that I say will bring him back.” Buttigieg said the issue of racism and policing “threatens the well-being of every community” and vowed to continue to help find solutions locally and nationally. The discussion moved to other candidates until Harris broke in. After words of introduction on the topic of race, she turned to Biden and the former prosecutor began to make her case. “I do not believe you are a racist, and I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground,” she said. “But I also believe, and it’s personal . . . it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country.” She continued: “And it was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing. And, you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me.” Earlier in the debate, as the conversation was spiraling out of control and the moderators were struggling to maintain order, Harris shut them all down with a quip that, even if prepared in advance, accomplished her goal of putting the focus on her. “Hey, guys, you know what? America does not want to witness a food fight,” she said. “They want to know how we are going to put food on their table.” Harris staked out positions that put her clearly in the liberal wing of the party, particularly on health care, positions that Republicans believe would make her vulnerable. But her goal on Thursday was not to persuade Republicans but to awaken Democrats to her candidacy’s potential, and on that she succeeded. Biden retains the goodwill of many Democrats, including African Americans, and continues to make the case that he is best positioned to defeat President Trump. But his performance probably will raise questions about his candidacy. Sanders, who defended his label of democratic socialist with typical confidence, retains a loyal following and will remain a force in the months ahead. But Bennet emerged as a voice prepared to challenge the progressive wing, in the way that Biden is expected to do. And Harris has put her stamp on her candidacy far more effectively than she had done before Thursday’s contest. As on Wednesday, Thursday’s debate highlighted the ideological tensions within the Democratic coalition, fissures that will dominate the nomination contest well into next year. Those tensions will test the priorities and loyalties of Democratic voters as they select their challenger to go against Trump in the general election. Some party strategists say their soundings so far this year suggest a streak of pragmatism among the Democratic electorate. They argue that many voters who would prefer a robustly liberal agenda are prepared to set aside some of those ambitions in favor of a candidate with whom they might disagree on some issues but believe has a better chance to deliver the White House in November 2020. Biden on the one hand, and Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on the other, seemed to represent the two poles in that debate, until the Democrats came to Miami. Now the choices seem to have widened, with new and younger voices rising to make themselves heard. The first round of debates is now in the archive. Some moments on the highlight reels from both nights will live through the weekend and into the next week but probably will have a limited shelf life. Few anticipated that the debates would significantly alter the shape of the race, and perhaps that is the case. But Harris showed that things can change, and Democrats will leave Miami with a fresh sense of the possibilities before them.

{"global_context": "President Donald Trump and his Republican allies on Friday escalated a campaign against U.S. law enforcement agencies over their probe into Russia by making public a classified memo that the FBI had sought to keep under wraps. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and his Republican allies on Friday escalated a campaign against U.S. law enforcement agencies over their probe into Russia by making public a classified memo that the FBI had sought to keep under wraps. The document, drawn up by congressional Republicans, alleges bias against Trump at the FBI and Justice Department in the investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and ties between Moscow and the Trump campaign. Ignoring a plea from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Trump approved the release of the memo, deepening an extraordinary showdown between the president and senior law enforcement officials over a probe that has dogged him during his first year in office. Trump declassified the four-page memo, telling reporters its contents told a disgraceful story of bias against him, and Republicans on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee released it to the public. The document has become a flashpoint in a battle between Republicans and Democrats over Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s criminal probe into possible collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia to sway the 2016 election. Democrats say the memo uses cherry-picked classified information, and they believe Trump’s allies might use it to give him a reason to fire U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who hired Mueller, or even Mueller himself. Asked on Friday by reporters if he had confidence in Rosenstein, Trump replied, “You figure that one out.” The document alleges the FBI concealed the Democratic ties of a source the agency used to justify surveillance on a former Trump campaign worker. It says a string of senior Justice Department officials signed off on this. “A lot of people should be ashamed,” Trump said of the findings in the document. Trump has repeatedly complained about Mueller’s investigation, denying any collusion or obstruction of justice. Moscow has denied any election meddling. In a tweet on Friday, Trump accused top U.S. law enforcement officers - some of whom he appointed himself - of politicizing investigations. It was his latest attack on top justice officials. Trump fired FBI Director James Comey last May. Comey later told a congressional hearing that he believed his removal was an effort by Trump to undermine the Russia probe. Senator John McCain, who is regarded as a heavyweight in Congress on foreign affairs, strongly criticized his fellow Republicans and Trump for attacking the FBI and the Justice Department. “If we continue to undermine our own rule of law, we are doing Putin’s job for him,” McCain said in a statement on Friday, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. A copy of the formerly top secret classified memo written by House Intelligence Committee Republican staff and declassified for release by U.S. President Donald Trump is seen shortly after it was released by the committee in Washington, February 2, 2018. REUTERS/Jim Bourg MEMO DETAILS The document, commissioned by the Republican chairman of the House intelligence panel, Devin Nunes, uses the case of investigations into Trump campaign aide Carter Page, saying the FBI used a biased source to justify surveillance on him. It alleges that a dossier of Trump-Russia contacts compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele, and funded in part by U.S. Democrats, formed an “essential part” of requests to a special court to be allowed to conduct electronic surveillance on Page that began in October 2016. It says the initial application and subsequent renewal applications, signed off on by various senior Justice Department officials including Rosenstein, did not mention the link between Steele and the Democrats. It also portrays Steele as biased, saying he “was passionate about him (Trump) not being president.” Slideshow (7 Images) The memo largely repeated allegations that Nunes and others had made publicly previously and did not appear to include major surprises. Two days ago, in a rare public rebuke of the president and Republicans in Congress who were pushing to release the memo, the FBI said it had “grave concerns about material omissions of fact” in the document and said it should not be made public. In his swipe at U.S. law enforcement leadership on Twitter on Friday, Trump said, “The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans - something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago.” James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence under Democratic President Barack Obama, said Trump’s attack on the FBI and the Justice Department was the “pot calling the kettle black.” U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions indicated he planned to refer the allegations against the Justice Department and the FBI in the Republican memo to the department’s inspector general for investigation. Democrats said the memo released on Friday used only partial information. “The selective release and politicization of classified information sets a terrible precedent and will do long-term damage to the Intelligence Community and our law enforcement agencies,” Democrats on the House intelligence panel said in a statement. The Democrats said they hoped the committee would vote on Monday to release their own memo responding to the allegations. The entire file that the Justice Department used to apply for permission to eavesdrop on Page remains highly classified, making it hard to evaluate the memo’s contents. While the memo focuses on an October 2016 court application for electronic surveillance of Page, it omits the fact that Page appeared on the FBI’s radar screen much earlier, when he met in 2013 with Russians in New York who were officers of the Kremlin’s foreign intelligence service. There was no evidence that Page knew the people were Russian intelligence officers but the contacts raised FBI suspicions.

Queen Elizabeth II departs the Christmas Day Church service at on the Sandringham estate on December 25, 2018 in King's Lynn, England. Stephen Pond/Getty Images In case you forgot, the UK voted to leave the European Union back in 2016. Then-Prime Minister David Cameron resigned and Theresa May took his job. Several months later, May asked Parliament to trigger Article 50 and the two-year countdown to Brexit day began. That day is now two months away: March 29, 2019. Since then, there has been seemingly endless parliamentary in-fighting, perpetual debates, negotiations and proposals, dire economic warnings and travel advisories and apocalyptic headlines warning \"You will have no food!\" and \"Medicines will run out.\" The entire saga has left people's heads spinning and deeply worried about what the future will bring. Enter the Queen... In a rare break from the centuries-old tradition that dictates she keeps her political opinions to herself, Queen Elizabeth II sent a coded message last week, urging Britons to find \"common ground.\" \"As we look for new answers in the modern age, I for one prefer the tried and tested recipes, like speaking well of each other and respecting different points of view; coming together to seek out the common ground; and never losing sight of the bigger picture,\" the monarch said in a speech to a women's group last Thursday. It was an unusual move for the British sovereign, who has no political role and refrains from expressing her personal views. Sure, she didn't specifically use the word \"Brexit\" but as Jane Merrick points out, she didn't need to. Couched in very careful language, these comments were as far as her strictly politically neutral role as head of state allows her to go -- although some would say she took a small step over that invisible line. The way the remarks were highlighted by Buckingham Palace made it clear they were meant to be interpreted as an intervention on the biggest challenge facing the UK right now: How to break the Brexit deadlock. As March 29 inches ever closer the Queen, in her subtle way, is looking to nudge the country back in the right direction.

President Donald Trump touted his legislative victories, such as passing tax reform and repealing Obamacare’s individual mandate, in an interview with the New York Times, while chiding Democrats such as Sen. Joe Manchin, (D-WV) who refused to negotiate on the legislation. President Trump scolded Democrats who often suggested that they would be open to a bipartisan tax reform bill. However, Democrats such as Joe Manchin refused to make any concerted effort to construct a bipartisan tax bill with Republicans and the president. Trump told the New York Times, “ Like Joe Manchin. He talks. But he doesn’t do anything. He doesn’t do,” Mr. Trump said. “‘Hey, let’s get together, let’s do bipartisan.’ I say, ‘Good, let’s go.’ Then you don’t hear from him again.” Manchin told Sen. Bob Portman (R-OH) that he might support the Republican Tax Cuts and Jobs Act if only they were to drop the corporate tax rate to 25 percent and did not repeal Obamacare’s individual mandate. “They were determined to make this a political bill, a partisan bill, and they didn’t need anybody. They didn’t want anybody,” Manchin said the Wednesday when the Senate passed the Republican tax bill. “I even said, ‘Don’t you at least want the appearance — even if you get two or three of us — even if you get one of us?’” Sen. Joe Manchin faces a tough 2018 midterm election race against conservative candidate West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey or the establishment candidate Rep. Evan Jenkins (R-WV).

Morrisey said: I’m so grateful for the outpouring of support our campaign has received over the past three months. Our conservative message of protecting coal, limiting government, and defending our traditional West Virginia values is resonating across the state and the nation. Sen.

Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia is asking Dan Coats, Trump's director of national intelligence, to deliver to Congress a detailed assessment of whether Kim Jong Un is willing to take concrete measures that would significantly reduce North Korea's nuclear weapons stockpile or accept intrusive international inspections.

While Pompeo called his talks last weekend with North Korea officials \"productive,\" they accused him of engaging in \"gangster-like tactics\" by pressuring the country to give up its nuclear weapons. In his letter, Warner noted that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo remarked on July 8 that \"we had detailed, substantive conversations about the next steps toward a fully verified and complete denuclearization. … There will be verification connected to the complete denuclearization. That's what President Trump and Chairman Kim both agreed to.\" The Joint Statement issued by the president and the North Korean leader on June 12 stated that \"Kim Jong Un reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\" On June 13, Trump declared via tweet that \"everybody can now feel much safer than the day I took office.

{"global_context": "Reports claim Hillary Clinton shielded a top male staffer from accusations of sexual harassment during her first ill-fated campaign for president in 2008. With so many women still joining the #MeTo movement to report on their history of being sexually harassed, some are now saying “et tu Hillary” with reports that Clinton shielded a top male staffer from accusations of sexual harassment during her first ill-fated campaign for president in 2008. A bombshell report from The New York Times claims that on at least two occasions Hillary refused to fire senior advisor Burns Strider in 2008 after he was accused of sexually harassing a female campaign staffer. The Times quotes sources close to the Clinton campaign saying, “The campaign manager, Patti Solis Doyle, and other senior campaign officials discussed the situation involving Mr. Strider and Mrs. Clinton’s response at the time. Some of them were troubled that he was allowed to remain on the campaign.” “Mr. Strider, who was Mrs. Clinton’s faith adviser, a co-founder of the American Values Network, and sent the candidate scripture readings every morning for months during the campaign, was hired five years later to lead an independent group that supported Mrs. Clinton’s 2016 candidacy, Correct the Record, which was created by a close Clinton ally, David Brock,” the paper added. Late last year Clinton tried to capitalize on the “women’s issue” of sexual harassment by denouncing Hollywood movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, despite her long history of being closely associated with him over the last twenty years. “I was shocked and appalled by the revelations about Harvey Weinstein,” Clinton said in an October statement. “The behavior described by women coming forward cannot be tolerated. Their courage and the support of others is critical in helping to stop this kind of behavior.” Why it took a decade for this latest Hillary news to come to light is a vexing question for the media, especially coming on the heels of a story revealing a photo of Barack Obama meeting with notorious anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan, which was reportedly hidden for 13 years to protect Obama’s political ambitions. With the mainstream media constantly dodging questions over its collective slant in favor of Democrats, the timing of the release of these two stories coming years after it might damage either high profile Democrat exacerbates the accusations of bias.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Heavy fighting erupted on Friday in the South Sudanese town of Pagak near the border with Ethiopia when rebels launched an offensive against government forces, the rebels said. Rebel spokesman Lam Paul Gabriel told Reuters that the rebels were seeking to regain Pagak, which was captured by government forces on Aug. 7. \"We decided to launch an attack on them because Pagak is our base. They took it from us and we want to take it back,\" Gabriel said. \"We cannot say right now that we are in full control but we are going towards taking control.\" Dickson Gatluak Jock, a spokesman for the forces of South Sudan's First Vice President Taban Deng Gai, confirmed that they were engaged in fighting. \"At 5:00 am, SPLA-IO forces (loyal to the Juba government) came under heavy fire (from the rebels) in Pagak ... Their main aim was to drive out our forces from the strategic town of Pagak,\" he told Reuters.

Machar has been under house arrest in South Africa since December as regional leaders try to bring about an end to the conflict. The rebels fighting government forces in South Sudan remain loyal to Machar.

TEL AVIV – The United Arab Emirates (UAE) Foreign Minister Anwar Gargash on Saturday said that Iran’s “aggressive policies” were “largely responsible” for the U.S. decision to reimpose sanctions against Tehran, Reuters reported. The U.S. has demanded that Iran end its support for terror proxies in Syria and stop its nuclear and ballistic missile development in order to see the sanctions lifted. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the sanctions are “aimed at fundamentally altering the behavior of the Islamic Republic of Iran.” France, Germany, Britain and the European Union condemned the U.S. move, issuing a joint statement that pledged to protect European companies involved in “legitimate” business dealings with Tehran. In a nod to the tagline of the popular TV series Game of Thrones, Trump tweeted a picture of himself surrounded by fog with the phrase “Sanctions are Coming, November 5.” The sanctions will impact countries that fail to stop importing Iranian oil as well as conduct business dealings with the rogue regime’s financial institutions, banking sector and Iranian officials. The timing of the new sanctions coincides with the anniversary of the 1979 raid on the US embassy in Tehran by Iranian revolutionaries. On Sunday, the regime orchestrated a protest at the site of the former U.S. embassy in downtown Tehran with demonstrators setting U.S. and Israeli flags alight, as well as holding signs reading “Down with USA” and “Down with Israel.”.

{"global_context": "Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said on Tuesday he had withdrawn from consideration to head the U.S. military as reports of domestic violence in his family surfaced, stoking uncertainty about the leadership of the Pentagon as tensions with Iran rise. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said on Tuesday he had withdrawn from consideration to head the U.S. military as reports of domestic violence in his family surfaced, stoking uncertainty about the leadership of the Pentagon as tensions with Iran rise. Shanahan said he made the decision, announced first by U.S. President Donald Trump in a tweet, to prevent his three children from reliving “a traumatic chapter in our family life.” “It is unfortunate that a painful and deeply personal family situation from long ago is being dredged up,” Shanahan, a former Boeing executive, said in a statement. Trump said the secretary of the Army, Mark Esper, will be named as the new acting defense secretary. Shanahan had been due to go before the Senate to be confirmed in the Pentagon top job but the alleged domestic violence incidents emerged as the FBI was conducting background checks ahead of a Senate confirmation hearing. USA Today reported that the FBI had been examining a nine-year-old domestic dispute involving Shanahan and his then-wife. The newspaper reported that Shanahan said he “never laid a hand on” his former wife. But USA Today reported that both he and his wife had claimed they had been punched by the other. The Washington Post reported a gruesome incident involving Shanahan’s teenage son allegedly hitting his mother, Shanahan’s ex-wife, with a baseball bat, leaving her unconscious in a pool of blood. “Bad things can happen to good families . . . and this is a tragedy, really,” Shanahan was quoted telling the Washington Post this week. He added the disclosure of the incident would “ruin my son’s life.” Pentagon officials could not be immediately reached for comment about the domestic violence reports or about Trump’s announcement. The decision to stand down, which Trump had said owed to Shanahan’s desire to spend more time with his family, promises to prolong what has already been the longest period without a confirmed secretary of defense. Shanahan was the longest official in history to serve as secretary of defense in only an acting capacity, according to Pentagon records. FILE PHOTO: Acting U.S. Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan speak to the media at the State Department in Washington, U.S., April 19, 2019. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File Photo Trump’s critics had already questioned whether Shanahan, without Senate confirmation, had the power to stand up to Trump if he had a difference of opinion on military strategy, since his nomination could be withdrawn at any time. Shanahan did not have prior experience in national security matters before he was picked by then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to be his deputy. Shanahan had been in the job, in an acting capacity, since Mattis stepped down at the end of 2018 citing policy differences with Trump. A source familiar with the situation said Shanahan met Trump in the Oval Office on Tuesday morning, telling him that he wanted to step down. The source, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said the decision was 100 percent Shanahan’s.

{"global_context": "Who are the candidates vying for British Prime Minister Theresa May's job and what have they said about Brexit?. (Reuters) - Who are the candidates vying for British Prime Minister Theresa May’s job and what have they said about Brexit? Former British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who is running to succeed Theresa May as Prime Minister, leaves his home in London, Britain, June 5, 2019. REUTERS/Henry Nicholls May has announced she is quitting, triggering a contest that will bring a new leader to power, with most of the frontrunners expected to push for a cleaner break with the European Union. Below are the 11 Conservative lawmakers who have said they are running and what they have said about Brexit. They are arranged in the order listed by oddschecker, a website that compiles bookmakers’ odds. BORIS JOHNSON, 54 The bookmakers’ clear favorite was the face of the official campaign to leave the European Union. The former London mayor resigned as foreign minister in July last year in protest at May’s handling of the exit negotiations. Johnson said in a campaign video that Britain would leave the EU on October 31 “deal or no deal”. He has also said a second referendum on EU membership would be a “very bad idea” and divisive. In a newspaper column, he said: “No one sensible would aim exclusively for a no-deal outcome. No one responsible would take no-deal off the table.” “If we are courageous and optimistic, we can strike a good bargain with our friends across the Channel, come out well and on time – by October 31 – and start delivering on all the hopes and ambitions of the people.” Local media reported he told a leadership hustings that the Conservatives would not be forgiven if Britain did not leave the EU by Oct. 31 and would face “political extinction.” Johnson was educated at Eton College and Oxford University. MICHAEL GOVE, 51 Gove, one of the highest-profile Brexit campaigners during the 2016 referendum, scuppered Johnson’s 2016 leadership bid by withdrawing his support at the last moment to run himself. Seen as one of the most effective members of May’s cabinet as environment minister, Gove backed her Brexit strategy. On Brexit: Gove said he believed he could unite the party and deliver Brexit. Writing in the Daily Mail newspaper, Gove said he would seek a Canada-style free trade agreement with the EU, ruled out a second referendum, and pledged that Conservative lawmakers would be involved in shaping Britain’s negotiating position. “We must leave the EU as soon as we can. I want us to leave before October 31 and that will be my goal. I won’t be engaging in can-kicking or dithering,” he said, adding that he would “always choose Brexit over no Brexit”. “If, finally, it comes to a decision between no deal and no Brexit, I will choose no deal - it’s a democratic imperative that we must leave the EU before the next general election or we risk letting (opposition Labour leader) Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street. I’ve been involved in no deal planning. I recognize, of course, it would mean short-term turbulence, but we would get through it and ultimately prosper,” he said. But Gove said he would not give up on progress and rush into a no deal when a deal could be reached “just a little more time and effort”. Doing so could mean parliament forcing Britain into a general election, he said. Gove, who was adopted as a child, was educated at Oxford University. ANDREA LEADSOM, 56 A pro-Brexit campaigner, Leadsom made it to the last two in the 2016 contest to replace Cameron. She withdrew after a backlash to an interview in which she said being a mother gave her more of a stake in the future of the country, seen by critics as an unfair attack on May, who has no children. Leadsom quit as Leader of the House of Commons last month, saying she did not believe the government’s approach would deliver on the Brexit referendum result. On Brexit: She told the Sunday Times she would put significant effort into encouraging the EU to come up with a “deal that we can all live with” but also said Britain had to leave by the end of October, with or without a deal. Leadsom was educated at the University of Warwick before spending 25 years in banking and finance. JEREMY HUNT, 52 Hunt replaced Johnson as foreign minister in July after serving six years as health minister. That role made him unpopular with many voters who work in or rely on the state-run, financially stretched National Health Service. On Brexit: A remain supporter in the 2016 referendum, Hunt now says that while he would prefer to leave the EU with a deal, he believes a no deal exit is better than no Brexit. However, in a Daily Telegraph article he became the most senior figure vying to succeed May to reject a threat to leave with no deal by the end of October, saying lawmakers would block any such move. “Any prime minister who promised to leave the EU by a specific date – without the time to renegotiate and pass a new deal – would, in effect, be committing to a general election the moment parliament tried to stop it. And trying to deliver no deal through a general election is not a solution; it is political suicide,” he wrote. “A different deal is, therefore, the only solution ... That means negotiations that take us out of the customs union while generously respecting legitimate concerns about the Irish border.” He has not however entirely ruled out a no-deal exit, saying he could consider it as a last resort. Hunt was educated at Oxford. He speaks fluent Japanese. DOMINIC RAAB, 45 Raab quit as May’s Brexit minister last year after just five months in the job, saying her draft exit agreement did not match the promises the Conservative Party made in the 2017 election. He had held junior ministerial roles since being elected in 2010. Raab, a black belt in karate, campaigned for Brexit. On Brexit: Raab told the BBC that he plans to seek a “fairer deal” with Brussels, including renegotiating the customs and border plans relating to Northern Ireland. He also said he would not delay Brexit beyond October however, and was prepared to leave without a deal. Raab said he expected that if Britain left without a deal, it would be likely get to keep around 25 billion pounds of its 39 billion pound exit payment, and the government could use that money to support businesses through Brexit. The son of a Jewish refugee, Raab was educated at Oxford University. RORY STEWART, 46 A former diplomat who once walked 6,000 miles across Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and Nepal, Stewart was recently promoted to International Development Secretary. Stewart was first elected to parliament in 2010 and backed remaining in the EU in the 2016 referendum. He opposes a “no deal” exit and has been a vocal advocate of May’s deal with Brussels. On Brexit: He told Sky News that he favored a “pragmatic, moderate Brexit”. He said he would not seek to change May’s withdrawal agreement which has been rejected by parliament three times and said anyone who said they could do so by October was “deluding themselves or deluding the country”. “We have a deal negotiated with the European Union on the Withdrawal Agreement. What I would be doing in parliament and with the British people is sorting out that political declaration and landing it so we can get out and move on.” Stewart was educated at Eton College and Oxford University. SAJID JAVID, 49 Javid, a former banker and a champion of free markets, has served in a number of cabinet roles and scores consistently well in polls of party members. A second-generation immigrant of Pakistani heritage, he has a portrait of late Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on his office wall. On Brexit: Javid voted “Remain” in the 2016 referendum but was previously considered a eurosceptic. Javid wants to reshape the existing Brexit deal and get it through parliament, but would be prepared to leave without a deal if that proves impossible. “We should leave on October 31. And if we cannot get a deal we should, with great regret, leave without one, having done everything we can to minimize disruption,’ he wrote in the Daily Mail. He wants to ramp up no deal preparations to show the EU that Britain is serious about walking away from talks. Javid also said he was against a second referendum: “Never in this country’s history have we asked people to go to the polls a second time without implementing their verdict from the first.” Javid, the son of a bus driver, was educated at Exeter University. MATT HANCOCK, 40 Health minister Hancock, a former economist at the Bank of England, supported “Remain” in 2016. First elected to parliament in 2010, he has held several ministerial roles. On Brexit: He told BBC Radio that leaving without a deal was not an option as parliament would not allow it. He said he was open to renegotiating May’s deal with the EU but would focus on getting a Brexit deal through parliament. Writing in the Daily Mail, he said the Conservatives needed to win back both pro-Brexit and pro-remain voters who had deserted it for other parties. He told Sky News he planned to renegotiate the future relationship with the EU and would explore the possibility of changing the Withdrawal Agreement. “We need to leave the EU with a deal before 31st October. I still think that is deliverable,” he said. Hancock was educated at Oxford University. ESTHER MCVEY, 51 The pro-Brexit former television presenter, who resigned as work and pensions minister in November in protest at May’s exit deal with the EU, said on Sunday Britain has to leave on Oct. 31 and “if that means without a deal, then that is what it means.” On Brexit: She wrote in the Daily Telegraph that no government she led would ever seek an extension beyond Oct. 31. “We need to stop wasting time having artificial debates about renegotiating backstops or resurrecting botched deals. The only way to deliver the referendum result is to actively embrace leaving the EU without a deal,” she said. McVey, who was placed in a foster home shortly after she was born but later returned to her parents, was educated at Queen Mary University of London. MARK HARPER, 49 Harper, who was elected to parliament in 2005 after working as an accountant, has held junior ministerial positions and served as the government’s chief enforcer in parliament under former Prime Minister David Cameron. In 2014 he resigned as immigration minister after it emerged his cleaner did not have permission to work in Britain. On Brexit: Harper supported remaining in the EU at the 2016 referendum but says he would now vote to leave. He told Sky News he would extend Article 50 to give time to secure an exit deal. “I would rather be realistic with people and say actually if you want to leave with a deal, you want a serious attempt to get a good deal then it simply can’t be done by Oct. 31.” “I want to leave with a deal but I do think if we can’t get a deal that goes through parliament we need to leave without a Withdrawal Agreement but I think we will only persuade a majority in parliament of that if they think we have made a serious real attempt.” He was educated at Oxford University. SAM GYIMAH, 42 Gyimah is the only candidate to back another Brexit referendum. A former investment banker and entrepreneur, Gyimah entered parliament after the 2010 election. He was promoted to minister for universities in January 2018, but resigned 10 months later over May’s Brexit deal. He said he was joining the contest to “broaden the race”.

The Trump-approved criticism comes a day after Brennan bashed Trump's \"lifelong pre-occupation with aggrandizing himself.\" “John Brennan, no single figure in American history has done more to discredit the intelligence community than this liar.

Bush and Barack Obama, and that while he didn't always agree with their policy, he \"never doubted that each treated their solemn responsibility to lead our nation with anything less than the seriousness, intellectual rigor and principles that it deserved.\" That changed with Trump for Brennan. \"Mr. Trump, however, has shown highly abnormal behavior by lying routinely to the American people without compunction, intentionally fueling divisions in our country and actively working to degrade the imperfect but critical institutions that serve us.\" Brennan's criticism of Trump is nothing new, the former intelligence official notes, and he's been slammed in the past for going after the president. In March, Brennan tweeted \"America will triumph over you\" while retweeting a Trump post that called ex-FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe's firing \"a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI.\" He also called Trump a \"deeply flawed person\" after the president used a vulgar term to refer to people from Haiti and other foreign nations. Brennan served as CIA director and Homeland Security adviser under Obama.

Robin Kelly, joined immigration activists and community leaders on Chicago's South Side Thursday to warn people about hardline tactics allegedly being used to detain residents. Agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement are wrongly identifying themselves as police officers and allegedly rounding up people without criminal records to process them for deportation, they said. \"I'm appalled at the actions of ICE,\" state Rep. Barbara Flynn Currie, D-25th, said at the event outside Our Lady of Guadalupe Church, 3200 E. 91st St. \"I'm appalled at the idea of racial profiling, of stereotyping, of agents who do not respect the rights of people that they haul off as they are just walking down the street, coming out of the grocery store. This is wrong and it must stop.\" A woman named Rosa spoke about how ICE agents allegedly wearing vests marked \"police\" stopped her husband in July as he exited a grocery store on his way to work. Rosa and her children didn't know what happened to him for two days, she said. The family provider disappeared in an instant and has been in federal custody ever since, she said. They're afraid of losing their home, she said, and being able to afford medicine for their youngest child. Like many others in the community, Rosa is afraid of being rounded up and deported. \"These tactics do not protect public safety,\" said Kate Ramos, a staff attorney with the National Immigrant Justice Center. \"They degrade community trust in the police and they ultimately separate families and rob all Chicagoans of the neighbors we care about.\" None of the speakers Thursday said what Rosa's husband's occupation was or whether he had a criminal record. I followed up with phone and email inquiries Thursday afternoon but did not immediately receive responses. I reached out to ICE's Chicago office for a response, and spokeswoman Nicole Alberico provided a statement. \"As a standard practice, ICE agents and officers may initially identify themselves as 'police' during an encounter because it is the universally recognized term for law enforcement,\" the statement said. ICE does not conduct sweeps or raids, the statement said, but rather targeted enforcement against criminal aliens. \"While conducting targeted enforcement, ICE officers will sometimes encounter other immigration violators, who can be subject to arrest at the time of encounter for violating U.S. immigration laws,\" ICE said. Currie praised Mayor Rahm Emanuel for Chicago's \"sanctuary city\" policy. President Donald Trump's administration wants to require cities applying for federal grants that fund public safety technology to give notice when immigrants in the country illegally are about to be released from custody and allow immigration agents access to local jails, the Chicago Tribune reported. Chicago, thus far, is prevailing in a legal challenge to new Department of Justice rules announced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions that would require sanctuary cities to cooperate with immigration agents. I imagine Chicago's 10th Ward on the Southeast Side is like a front line in a battle over national immigration policy. I think many would agree with notions like a more secure southern border and deportation of violent criminals who entered the country illegally. That's the public sentiment Trump tapped into when he campaigned on building a wall and calling some immigrants \"rapists\" and \"bad hombres.\" I think it's a stretch, though, to say public opinion favors deportation of every undocumented immigrant. I think most are hard-working people who fled desperate conditions in their native countries in hopes of creating better lives for their families in America. I think it's important to treat other human beings with compassion and to remember that the constitution guarantees rights to people — even those who entered without permission. \"You have a right to remain silent,\" Ramos said. \"If detained, you have the right to speak with an attorney before answering any officer's questions or signing any papers.\" I think some choose to believe a false narrative that immigrants depend on welfare provided by taxpayers, instead of the reality that most pay taxes and contribute to the economy. There are those who want people to believe immigrants are stealing jobs from Americans, when in reality the country is closer to full employment than it's been in decades. The fact is, ICE deported a record number of criminal aliens during former President Barack Obama's administration. Since Trump took office, ICE is having a hard time matching those numbers, the Washington Post recently reported. \"As of Sept. 9, three weeks before the end of the 2017 fiscal year, ICE had deported 211,068 immigrants, according to the most recent figures provided by the agency. ICE removed 240,255 people during the government's 2016 fiscal year,\" the Post said. Citing statistics provided by ICE, the Post said 28,000 \"non-criminal immigration violators\" were arrested between Jan. 22 and Sept. 2. Presumably, Rosa's husband would be included among the statistics. \"This administration's inhumane roundups are not based on criminal history but rather on hateful profiling,\" Kelly, D-2nd, said at the event Thursday. \"These are hard-working people, business owners and parents trying to build a better life for their families,\" Kelly said. \"My faith and my conscience prevent me from supporting this inhumane policy.\" tslowik@tronc.com Twitter @tedslowik.

{"global_context": "The Trump he described was even more amoral than we could have imagined. Columnist In Michael Cohen’s historic testimony Wednesday, there was a moment when the long-lost spines of President Trump’s political enablers, probably heaped in a clattering pile somewhere, must have felt a chill. It was when Cohen looked at his Republican inquisitors and foretold their future. “I did the same thing you are doing now for 10 years,” Cohen said, sounding like an Old Testament prophet. “I protected Mr. Trump for 10 years. . . . And I can only warn [that] people that follow Mr. Trump, as I did blindly, are going to suffer the same consequences that I’m suffering. . . . Look at what’s happened to me. I had a wonderful life. I have a beautiful wife. I have two amazing children. I achieved financial success by the age of 39. I didn’t go to work for Mr. Trump because I had to. I went to work for him because I wanted to. And I have lost it all.” Cohen’s warning was ignored by those present. But his revelations advanced the inevitable day of reckoning — for Trump, his family and his party. Early in his opening statement before the House Oversight Committee, Cohen gave a description of Trump that will go down in the annals of congressional testimony: “He is a racist, he is a con man, and he is a cheat.” Incredibly, none of the Republicans on the panel even tried to refute the claim that the president of the United States is, in his essence, an unscrupulous grifter. One of them, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), did make a clueless and embarrassing attempt to defend Trump against the charge of racism. He brought out Lynne Patton — an African American friend of the Trump family who, with utterly no relevant qualifications or experience, was given a high-ranking job in the Department of Housing and Urban Development — as evidence that Trump is not a racist. Patton stood silently in the background, like an artifact on exhibit. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) was absolutely right to slam Meadows for using a black woman as “a prop.” For the record, it’s entirely possible to have a black friend and still be a racist. If you can’t or won’t understand that fact, you may be a racist yourself. But I digress. Another Republican made a weak attempt to challenge Cohen on one of his more sensational claims — that Trump never expected to win the presidency and instead saw his campaign as the “greatest infomercial in political history.” But there was no real effort to dispute Cohen’s many specific charges against Trump or even to question his shocking portrait of the man he once idolized. Instead, the GOP strategy was to follow the old courtroom adage: If the facts are against you, pound the law. If the law is against you, pound the facts. And if both are against you, pound the table. Oh, the table-pounding! Republicans found it outrageous that Cohen, whose admitted crimes include having once lied to Congress, was being allowed to sit there and testify, rather than, I don’t know, being dragged down to the basement and horsewhipped. How could anyone ever believe anything he had to say? Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) was so overwrought that I feared he might pull a muscle when he briefly thought he had caught Cohen in a lie on a boilerplate witness form. It turned out that Jordan was wrong — Cohen filled in the form correctly — and all the congressman injured was his pride. Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), the committee’s chairman, did a masterful job of presiding over the circus. He saved his best for last, ending the hearing with a closing statement that appealed to the better angels of our nature, wherever they might be hiding. “We’re better than this,” he thundered. And I so hope he’s right. But I fear there will be darkness before the dawn. Thanks largely to clever, substantive questioning by junior Democrats — New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez being perhaps the cleverest — there are new leads to follow. Cohen spoke of a whispered exchange between Trump and his son Donald Trump Jr. that suggests, but does not prove, that Trump colluded with the Russians. Cohen said the Trump Organization committed insurance fraud and was involved in other unspecified criminal activity. He gave the House Democratic majority ample reason to subpoena Trump’s income taxes. But the Trump he described was even more ruthless, selfish, amoral, dishonest and insecure — more unfit to be president — than we could have imagined. Getting him out of office is an urgent task for our democracy. We must be up to it. Read more from Eugene Robinson’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson UNITED NATIONS/HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba urged the United States on Friday to cooperate with its investigation into incidents that the U.S. says have harmed its diplomats in Havana and not to politicize the matter, days after Washington said it was considering closing its Cuban embassy. In an address to the United Nations General Assembly, Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said the top level of the government in Havana had ordered an investigation into the mysterious matter, which threatens the fragile detente between the old Cold War foes. However, a Cuban government source told Reuters that the United States had provided no evidence of the harm, including hearing loss, dizziness and nausea, that it says U.S. diplomats and their relatives based in Havana have suffered. Cuban doctors had also not been allowed to examine anyone, the source said. A spokesman for the U.S. embassy in Havana declined to comment. “The investigation to clarify this issue continues, and in order to be able to arrive to a conclusion, it will be crucial to count on the cooperation of the U.S. authorities,” Rodriguez told the U.N. “It would be unfortunate if a matter of this nature is politicized,” said Rodriguez. Cuba has denied any involvement in the affair.

Investigations by Cuba, the United States and Canada have yet to come up with any answers. Experts agree it is hard to see how any attacks could have been carried out or what the motivation could be. Theories abound, from surveillance technology gone awry to a sophisticated acoustic weapon in the hands of Cuban-American exiles or third-party state actors such as Russia, Iran or North Korea, but most flounder. Audiologists for example have raised doubt over the possibility of whether any sonic weapon exists that can be used covertly to bring about the range of symptoms mentioned by diplomats.

Dick Heller, who took his Second Amendment rights to the Supreme Court and changed the landscape of firearm ownership in the District, is pictured outside the Supreme Court. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) Dick Heller, a 76-year-old special police officer whose Supreme Court case changed the District’s gun laws a decade ago, arrives on Capitol Hill in style. Speaking to a women’s gun rights group last week, days ahead of the decision’s 10th anniversary Tuesday, he’s wearing a “Make America Free Again” baseball cap. It is pouring rain, but he’s riding a bike, protected by a poncho. He introduces himself as “Dude Heller,” shakes a few hands, gives a 10-minute speech in which he calls the District “a colony that has no use for the Constitution” and leaves before the event is over. For him, this is what victory looks like. “I didn’t ask for bazookas, tanks and flamethrowers,” he said. “I just asked for my gun.” [D.C. Circuit upholds right to bear arms for D.C. residents] Heller was back at the Supreme Court for a rally Tuesday marking 10 years since what he called the “magnificent decision.” In the decade that has passed, nationwide debates about the Second Amendment have grown more heated, although officials say the Heller decision has probably had little effect on the city’s gun violence.

(Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post) On Tuesday, realizing that a gun rights rally was unfolding steps away, protesters condemning the Supreme Court’s 5-to-4 decisions on abortion notices in pregnancy centers and President Trump’s travel ban migrated to the event meant to honor Heller. They shouted slogans such as “Free D.C.” and “D.C. law for D.C. people” at Second Amendment supporters, occasionally drowning out a faulty sound system. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who was scheduled to speak, didn’t appear because of the “high security situation,” said Tyler Yzaguirre, president of the Second Amendment Institute and the event’s organizer. Ann Elise Trafford, who joined in the chants, said she grew up blocks from Heller’s home on Capitol Hill. She didn’t understand why people from around the country were in the District to support him and a case she considers a local issue. “We’ve had neighbors lost to gun violence,” she said. “I haven’t yet met a single person [at this rally] from D.C.” Heller, standing at a lectern in a short-sleeve button-down shirt and sunglasses, didn’t shrink.

(Gerald Herbert/AP) “We are supporters of the First Amendment,” he said. “We are on the same team.” For gun rights advocates, Heller’s story never gets old. The former paratrooper and, as he put it, “I.T. jock” moved to Capitol Hill in 1976 and he lived near the troubled Kentucky Courts public housing complex. He wanted a gun to protect himself. “Matt Dillon on ‘Gunsmoke’ was my favorite actor,” he said. “I said, ‘I need one of those.’ ” But Heller’s desire ran afoul of D.C. gun laws. He was allowed to carry a handgun while working at the Federal Judicial Center, the judicial branch’s research and education agency, but he couldn’t register a weapon to keep at home. Only government workers benefited from his right to bear arms, he said. “I was given a gun to protect them but couldn’t own a gun to protect me after I turned in my gun protecting them,” Heller said. [From 2008: Dick Heller registers his revolver] This set up a decades-long battle that ended in 2008 when the Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 that people — not just those serving in militias — have a right to possess firearms. Lawyers on different sides of the issue said the decision provided the answer to a 200-year-old question. “I think its most important contribution was to establish the right to bear arms as an individual right,” said Robert A. Levy, chairman of the libertarian Cato Institute, who personally funded the litigation. “It shifts the burden of proof to the government if government proposed gun- control regulations — and, by the way, I don’t think anyone denies reasonable regulations are appropriate.” [Hundreds apply to carry loaded, concealed handguns in D.C. Most don’t live there.] The case preceded a court decision last year striking down the District’s requirement that people seeking licenses to carry concealed weapons must demonstrate a “good reason.” The city decided not to appeal the case, Wrenn v. District of Columbia, to the high court, saying an unfavorable ruling would put similar concealed-carry restrictions nationwide in jeopardy. [D.C. will not appeal concealed carry gun ruling to Supreme Court] D.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham said 1,200 people have sought city concealed-carry permits, including about 500 who don’t live in the District. He said he doesn’t think Heller affected crime rates in the city because those seeking permits through legal channels generally aren’t contributing to violence. “I just don’t think people are by and large interested in carrying a firearm in the District of Columbia,” Newsham said. “The tough part for us is the people that want to carry them illegally.” Adam Skaggs, chief counsel for the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a San Francisco-based nonprofit organization that supports gun regulations, said the Heller decision wasn’t the victory the amendment’s enthusiasts make it out to be. Although Justice Antonin Scalia recognized gun ownership is an individual right, he also said that right was limited. “As a practical matter, Heller did not have the consequence of sweeping most American gun laws into the dustbin of history,” Skaggs said. “Its political, rhetorical and psychological impact shouldn’t be underestimated. In terms of being a turning point in which gun regulation is no longer possible in America, that would dramatically be overstating [its effect].” Heller, a self-described libertarian, seemed no less elated as he jetted from speaking engagement to speaking engagement last week while holding down his day job as a security officer at a private company. Changes in the gun debate, such as the national conversation that followed the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., in February, don’t have him doubting his stance. “We used to take our guns to school,” he said. “Nobody had any issues like occurred today. The culture’s changed. . . . The guns don’t jump out of the holster and shoot people.” Heller’s brief speech last week didn’t disappoint members of the DC Project, which works to bring 50 women — one from each state — to the District each year to meet their lawmakers and advocate for gun rights. Amanda Suffecool, an Ohio radio host and rally coordinator with the group, said that when Heller shows up at a Second Amendment event, “there’s a line.” “To me, Dick Heller has been a hero,” she said. “When you see one man take on the government because he was right, you have to admire him.” Peter Hermann and Ann E.

Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha uses a cardboard cutout to evade the media in Bangkok on Jan. 8. (EPA-EFE) But Human Rights Watch, a New York-based nongovernmental organization, strongly criticized the incident Tuesday, saying that it was part of a “long list of his bizarre and bullying reactions to reporters.” According to the Associated Press, Prayuth had previously thrown a banana peel at journalists and threatened others with execution, in what appeared to be a particularly tasteless joke. Press freedom has declined in Thailand and around the world in recent years, according to the press liberties watchdogs Article 19 and Freedom House, and intimidation and threats were not limited to authoritarian regimes. President Trump frequently lashes out at what he calls “fake news” and is now even initiating a “Fake News Award,” which he said in a tweet would be “going to the most corrupt & biased of the Mainstream Media.” Trump also was notorious during his presidential campaign for inciting crowds against the journalists present at his rallies. Last October, the Czech president waved a mock rifle at journalists during a news conference. For his part, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has repeatedly threatened journalists in widely condemned remarks, too. As a candidate, he was quoted as saying, “Just because you’re a journalist you are not exempted from assassination if you’re a son of a bitch.” When Duterte later met with Trump, his U.S. counterpart chuckled after Duterte called journalists “spies.” An official arranges cardboard cutouts of Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha in Bangkok on Jan. 9. (Athit Perawongmetha/Reuters) Then, last July during a photo opportunity, Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is frequently accused of undermining press freedom in his country, pointed at journalists in the room and asked Trump: “These are the ones hurting you?” Trump responded: “These are the ones. You're right about that.” The fear is that threats against the media by world leaders such as Trump will only further embolden the Thai leadership — and other governments — to impose more restrictions on journalists. Prayuth recently referred to “fake news,” deploying rhetoric similar to Trump’s. Freedom House classifies Thailand as “not free,” writing on its website that the military government “has systematically used censorship, intimidation, and legal action to suppress journalists and media outlets.” “Authorities aggressively enforce defamation and lèse majesté laws, and have summoned journalists for meetings at which they are pressured to stop producing coverage critical of the NCPO,” Freedom House reported, referring to the Thai military junta known as the National Council for Peace and Order. Human rights organization Amnesty International called the developments a “spiral into silence.” Prayuth came to power in 2014 following a military coup, initially conceived as a temporary solution to a tumultuous period in Thai history marked by street protests. But promised elections have repeatedly been delayed, and Prayuth’s government has expanded its powers instead. On Tuesday, the country’s Foreign Ministry confirmed that Prayuth’s predecessor, Yingluck Shinawatra, is now in Britain, where she sought refuge about a year ago. The former prime minister was previously sentenced to five years in prison on charges of negligence in a trial conducted in absentia. Critics allege that the trial was politically motivated and unfair, but their voices are unlikely to be widely reflected in Thai media, which is now banned from expressing opinions “inconsistent with the truth,” according to a vaguely worded 2016 Referendum Act.

{"global_context": "Chinese President Xi Jinping has spent five years consolidating his power by purging the Communist Party ranks of rivals, and tightening its grip on society. BEIJING — When Chinese President Xi Jinping strode into the room crammed with cameras and reporters on Wednesday, there seemed to be more curiosity about the six men who followed behind him. They were the new Communist Party Politburo Standing Committee, the most powerful decision-making council of China’s government. All handpicked Xi loyalists, they will implement his agenda for the next five years. Collectively they sent the clearest signal yet that China may be entering an era of strongman rule. None of them is an obvious successor to Xi. They are all aged in their 60s, and in five years would be too old to be considered for China’s top job. Chinese President Xi Jinping speaks at the podium at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. Lintao Zhang / Getty Images “A new era needs a new look, and even more, needs new accomplishments,” said Xi, who spoke to a packed room in the Great Hall of the People with his leadership team standing rod-straight and silent. Xi’s choice of men — the wider Politburo of 25 members includes only one woman — has fueled speculation that he may use his almost unparalleled authority to amend the constitution to allow him to rule an unprecedented third term as party chairman and China’s president. Their debut came at the end of the 19th Communist Party Congress, a twice-a-decade event that offers a rare glimpse at the secretive realm of Chinese politics. The policies and decisions made over the past week will guide China for the next five years. Photos: Grand Scenes and Tiny Moments at China's Party Congress As the world’s second-largest economy and an increasingly influential global player with investment on virtually every continent, what happens here can resonate everywhere. Here are some of the main takeaways from the Congress. The World’s Most Powerful Leader? Dubbed the “Chairman of Everything,” Xi has emerged from this Congress with near-absolute authority. Mao Zedong in 1966. STF / AFP - Getty Images, file Xi spent the last five years consolidating his power by purging the Communist Party ranks of rivals, and tightening its grip on Chinese society with restrictions on education, culture, the internet, religion, activism, and the environment. Importantly, the party voted to enshrine Xi’s name and political \"thoughts\" in its constitution. It means he is elevated in historical stature alongside Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, long considered modern China’s most influential leaders. The message to officials: there is no questioning or disputing Xi Jinping or his ideas. In one of the main takeaways of his address to the Congress, Xi said that if Mao made China independent and Deng made it prosper, then he would make it stronger. Welcome to the era of Xi. The lack of an apparent successor is already raising concerns of political turmoil ahead if ambitious party members grow uneasy with Xi’s power. A Rising China In his marathon three-and-a-half hour speech at the opening of the Congress, Xi hailed a “new era” for Chinese socialism.

Lintao Zhang / Getty Images China has billions of dollars in investment in industry, agriculture, and infrastructure projects across most of the world. Xi has built up the military, in particular the Navy, and boosted China’s profile on the world stage. To an extent, China’s rise has been enabled by President Trump’s “America First” approach to foreign policy and his rejection of international agreements such as the Paris Climate Accord, the Trans-Pacific Partnership and NAFTA. All the President’s Men The Standing Committee will implement Xi’s “vision” of a rejuvenated China. Chinese premier Li Keqiang, 62, is the only returning member of the Standing Committee. The five new members all have deep party resumes, though most are not considered long-time Xi associates: Han Zheng, 63, is a former mayor of Shanghai; Wang Yang, 62, who was party chief in Guangdong province, a manufacturing hub in southern China; Zhao Leji, 60, will take over the anti-corruption agenda that helped consolidate Xi’s control of the party; Wang Huning, 62, a former professor with an interest in (and low opinion of) U.S. politics; and Li Zhanshu, 67, who has worked most closely with Xi and is considered among his closest aides. Economy vs. Reforms China’s rapid economic growth has slowed, and the past five years saw a mandated push away from traditional manufacturing.

Mark Schiefelbein / AP The bigger concern facing China’s leadership now: the piles of debt accumulated by state-owned enterprises and local municipalities that have funded rampant (and often money-losing) construction. Experts do not expect Xi to move toward market reforms that would, for example, make it easier for foreign companies to do business here. “China’s economy is projected to grow more than three times as fast as the U.S. over the next five years,” said John Ross, senior fellow at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University in Beijing. “These projections are not from a pro-China source, but from the International Monetary Fund.” Regional Rivals It is worth noting how an empowered Xi and his vision of a stronger China fits into the bigger regional picture right now. In Japan, Shinzo Abe won a snap election to extend his hold on the government to a point where he could feasibly amend the constitution. Critics worry Abe may use that authority to remilitarize the country, which is currently prevented from participating in foreign conflicts. China’s relations with South Korea have been strained over Seoul’s deployment of U.S.-made missile defense systems that Beijing sees it as a threat to its own security. Beijing’s unofficial \"soft sanctions,\" such as barring Chinese group tours from visiting South Korea, have impacted its tourism industry.

And there is a federal judge, Newt Gingrich, somewhere in New York City that you are also comparing to Joseph Stalin and Adolf Hitler because they signed off on the warrants.” “And actually, when you start comparing Robert Mueller to Stalin or Hitler, you are not attacking Robert Mueller, you are attacking the United States of America,” he added. “You are attacking the United States Constitution. You are attacking the genius of our Founding Fathers to make sure that for over 240 years those sort of abuses haven’t happened here. And they’re still not happening here.

Jeremy Hunt has called on Boris Johnson not to be a “coward” by avoiding a live TV debate with him this week as the Tory leadership race turned personal. Hunt suggested dodging a Sky News head-to-head would risk his rival “slinking through the back door” of Number 10 as Johnson remained under pressure to explain why police were called to the home he shares with partner Carrie Symonds, Foreign Secretary Hunt has previously attacked Johnson over reports he was “bottling” a live TV debate before postal ballots are returned. In his column for the Daily Telegraph, Johnson attempted to switch attention back to political rather than personal issues as he repeated his determination to deliver Brexit by Halloween. Stepping up pressure on his rival, Hunt insisted that while he has no interest in debating Johnson’s private life, he wants to challenge him on television over his commitment to taking the UK out of the EU by the end of October. In an article in The Times, Hunt said: “A new prime minister needs the legitimacy of having made his arguments publicly and having them subjected to scrutiny. “Only then can you walk through the front door of No 10 with your head held high instead of slinking through the back door, which is what Boris appears to want.” He added: “Don’t be a coward Boris, man up and show the nation you can cope with the intense scrutiny the most difficult job in the country will involve.” Hunt said on Sunday that he thought any candidate for prime minister “should answer questions on everything”. Meanwhile, Johnson wrote in the Telegraph: “We must leave the EU on Oct 31 come what may. It will honour the referendum result, it will focus the minds of EU negotiators.” He added: “It is absolutely vital that we keep our eyes on the prize. It has been a long and parching march – but the oasis is finally in sight. “We are just over four months away from the date on which, by law, we must leave the EU; and this time we are not going to bottle it. We are not going to fail. “This time we are not going to shrink in fear from the exit, as we have on the last two occasions.” This is what I was writing about this morning. It's rubbish. Vacuous rubbish. You can't just bang on about \"mettle\" and \"creativity\". You have to set out a plan. An actual plan. https://t.co/LrdUKsUAIh — (((Dan Hodges))) (@DPJHodges) June 23, 2019 Earlier, Hunt took a swipe at his competitor for Downing Street after Johnson repeatedly refused to reveal what led to the police involvement in the early hours of Friday morning. Hunt told Sky News: “I think someone who wants to be prime minister should answer questions on everything. “But I’m not going to comment on issues of character because … I am sure you and I have got things, that, you know, we would be embarrassed if they came out. “I just think it’s irrelevant given the gravity of the situation. I am not going to comment on Boris’s personal life. That’s for others to make their judgments on.” The Foreign Secretary insisted his predecessor in the Cabinet role was trying to avoid scrutiny in the battle for Number 10. “What Boris needs to do is engage properly in this leadership debate. “This is an audition to be the prime minister of the United Kingdom and Boris needs to show that he is prepared to answer difficult questions.” Hunt supporter and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox signalled it was better to be clear about what had happened. Dr Fox told BBC1’s The Andrew Marr Show: “I think it is always easier to just give an explanation.” He added: “It is inevitable there is a focus on private lives. That does not concern me. What I am concerned about are the issues.” Johnson repeatedly refused to explain to Tory grassroots at a Saturday hustings what went on at the south London flat in the early hours of Friday morning, saying the party faithful did not want “to hear about that kind of thing”. Johnson’s campaign for Number 10 was rocked by the revelations that officers were called to the home he shares with partner Symonds by a neighbour who claimed to have been “frightened and concerned” after hearing shouting, “a loud scream” and banging coming from the property. A poll carried out after the reports emerged suggested Johnson’s support among Tory voters had dropped by more than half while among the general electorate it indicated he had slipped into second place behind rival Hunt. PA Wire/PA Images At the hustings, moderator Iain Dale drew heckles from some in the crowd when he asked Johnson whether a person’s private life had any bearing on someone’s ability to discharge the office of prime minister. “Don’t boo the great man,” Johnson said, but Dale suggested he was “completely avoiding” the question. On Saturday night, the neighbour who rang the Metropolitan Police went public after suggestions that his recording of the row had been leaked to The Guardian with political intent. Tom Penn said the allegations were “bizarre and fictitious”, explaining in a statement to the paper that he dialled 999 after hearing shouting coming from his neighbour’s flat. “It was loud enough and angry enough that I felt frightened and concerned for the welfare of those involved, so I went inside my own home, closed the door, and pressed record on the voice memos app on my phone,” the 29-year-old playwright said. “After a loud scream and banging, followed by silence, I ran upstairs, and with my wife agreed that we should check on our neighbours. “I knocked three times at their front door, but there was no response.

REUTERS/Ismail Sameem/File Photo General Abdul Razeq, one of Afghanistan’s most feared anti-Taliban commanders, was shot dead when a member of the provincial governor’s bodyguard opened fire on officials leaving a meeting with NATO forces commander General Scott Miller. Razeq, nominally the Kandahar police chief, was one of the most powerful figures in the whole of southern Afghanistan. He had a range of business interests and was accused of extracting millions of dollars from the border crossing into Pakistan at Spin Boldak, his home region and power base. A member of the powerful Pashtun Achakzai tribe and a skillful operator in the region’s complex tribal politics, he regularly clashed with Ghani’s government in Kabul but enjoyed wide support and was impossible to remove. The nomination of Razeq’s younger brother Tadeen Khan as acting police chief of Kandahar followed heavy pressure from powerful tribal elders who forced the government to overlook his lack of experience and training. Ghani’s government initially rejected the demand on the grounds that Khan lacked qualifications, a senior Afghan official said, but gave way after the Achakzais threatened to boycott parliamentary elections. “Ghani knows he will need the support of many tribes to retain power, so he has to listen to them and accept their demands,” said Abdul Rashid Khan a political science professor at Kabul University. Parliamentary elections, a dry run for the more important presidential election next year, will be held in Kandahar on Saturday after they were postponed for a week following Razeq’s death in an insider attack at the provincial governor’s office. His death left a power vacuum in Kandahar, one of the most strategically important provinces in Afghanistan, on the southeastern border with Pakistan. “It would require a lot of consultations and appeasement to convince general Razeq’s supporters and his tribe to approve someone else as the police chief,” said a senior government official as he explained the reason behind Khan’s appointment.

Steve Bannon (Photo: Alex Brandon, AP) Steve Bannon — the loathed architect of President Trump’s alt-right hate machine, Breitbart lies, racism, misogyny and Twitter thug troll factory — is banished to political Siberia. It was swift and decisive. Bannon is a deplorable human being who has no business being in a position of power or having the ear of any lawmaker. But as deplorable as he may be, his destruction by Trump and the sycophantic army Bannon helped incubate should frighten every American. Why? Because it’s not why he was taken down and kicked to the curb. The former top campaign strategist, former National Security Council member (appointed by Trump) and former Breitbart News chairman has been given the heave-ho by pretty much the entire Trump establishment. Yet just days ago, he was king and kingmaker, second only to Trump, and viewed by many as Trump’s Svengali. More: Trump team collusion with Russia? Ukraine connection may hold key. More: Michael Wolff book: Bannon's downfall with Trump, Breitbart and the Mercers? At Breitbart, Bannon created an online haven — a fertile safe space — for white nationalists and anti-Semites. Then he mobilized them behind a reality show host/failed casino owner/conspiracy theorist buffoon who won the GOP presidential nomination, largely because his outrageous clown show was ratings gold. Many right-wing media figures, authors and commentators had made their fame and fortune with a Clinton in the White House. They likely wanted a repeat of that success and no doubt believed a Trump nomination ensured a Hillary Clinton win. I’m guessing more than a few publishers have a stale anti-President Hillary book proposal or two gathering dust in a drawer. Bannon openly campaigned to tear down American institutions, the Republican Party and the government. His white nationalism was first ignored, then tolerated and even welcomed by some. When Trump brought him to the White House as a top aide, Bannon's appointment was cheered by leaders of the Ku Klux Klan, the American Nazi Party and other white nationalist groups. Backed by the power of enormous amounts of money from the uber-wealthy Mercers, Bannon and Breitbart were being normalized. They worked to normalize Trump. Such was Bannon’s ability to infiltrate society with his and Trump’s morally reprehensible attitudes, they both vigorously campaigned for Alabama's Senate candidate Roy Moore — who was credibly accused by multiple women of molesting them when they were adolescents and teens. Moore led in the polls for weeks before his defeat. Bannon is now ruined because in a few moments of uncharacteristic truth-telling to Fire and Fury author Michael Wolff, he shared the identical sentiments and concerns as his colleagues and most of his fellow citizens. He described suspicions and assumptions that nearly all of Washington, the press corps, Congress and many Americans share: that Trump knew full well his relatives and staff were meeting in Trump Tower with the Russians to get dirt on Hillary Clinton. Conspiracy and collusion. Let that sink in for a moment. When Bannon promoted white nationalism, misogyny, an accused child molester, severe online bullying and conspiracy theories, he was a king to the right-wing media, Trump and most of the Republicans in Congress. But when he dared to tell the truth, when confirmation from an insider could help save the country from the danger, Bannon was cut out like a member of Tony Soprano’s “family” who turned state’s evidence. It’s one thing for Trump to cut off ties to Bannon. But the wholesale embracing of Bannon’s political slaughter by conservative institutions for this, rather than for his past ugly sins, is quite another. Finally, dropped by the Mercers, and by extension and formally by Breitbart, Bannon is now a man without a country, friends or home. That conveys an ominous message: Do not criticize this American president or you will be destroyed. More: Trump's 'stable genius' reality check: America, this isn't a drill POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media It doesn’t matter who is the target, or that our disgust toward the likes of Bannon is appropriate and well-earned.

Not one White House staffer has publicly questioned whether Bannon’s words rang true. Not one Republican senator has suggested publicly that perhaps we should pay heed to Bannon’s words to Wolff. No one at Breitbart, or the Mercers, or the Republican National Committee or even Bannon’s Gilligan to his Skipper, Corey Lewandowski, seems curious about what Bannon said — and if it’s true, what danger the country may be in. The only concern is to protect and cover for Trump at all costs. Even so, Bannon and others who “know too much” can be dangerous to a president with a few too many secrets.

{"global_context": "President Donald Trump will order the Pentagon to create a unified combatant command for space, a step forward in the administration's plan to establish a Space Force. Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. By Daniel Barnes and Associated Press WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has ordered the Pentagon to create a unified combatant command for space operations, Vice President Mike Pence announced on Tuesday. \"The U.S. Space Command will integrate space capabilities across all branches of the military, it will develop the space doctrine, tactic, techniques and procedures that will enable our war fighters to defend our nation in this new era,\" Pence said during a speech at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Trump signed a one-page memorandum Tuesday authorizing the Defense Department to create the new command. The new order is separate from the president's much touted goal of creating a \"Space Force\" as an independent armed service branch, but is considered a first step in that direction. The memo provides little detail on what will be a long and complicated process as the Defense Department begins to pull together various space units from across the military services into a more coordinated, independent organization. Pence, in his speech, teased more to come on the Space Force front. \"In the days ahead, President Trump will also sign a new space policy directive that will lay out our plans and our timeline to create the sixth branch of the armed forces, the U.S. Space Force,\" Pence said. The idea of a Space Command is not new — the same command previously existed from 1985 to 2002 but was dissolved following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The Air Force maintained its own space command following 2002, but unified operations ceased. Pence had previously announced the administration's intention to create a Space Command during an August speech that laid out the White House's goal to set up a Space Force by 2020. The Pentagon has been working to create a policy proposal for Space Force that is expected to be presented to Congress early 2019. Pence framed space as the next war fighting domain, citing threats from China and Russia. \"China has tested missiles designed to destroy satellites. China and Russia are working to station new weapons directly in space,\" he said. Pence was in Florida to attend the launch of a new GPS satellite originally planned for today. The launch, which will use a SpaceX rocket, was scrubbed and rescheduled for tomorrow.

{"global_context": "\"He's been lying all week, he's been lying for years. ... I don't see how he has any credibility.\" Exactly. Rudy Giuliani, the president's current lawyer, was talking about Michael Cohen, the president's former lawyer. But if Cohen is so sleazy, and I don't disagree, why did Donald Trump keep the self-described fixer around for so long? As recently as April, Trump was calling Cohen a \"good man.\" As recently as May, Giuliani called Cohen \"an honest, honorable lawyer.\" Cohen's character didn't change. The damage he could inflict on Trump did. And here's the bigger problem with Giuliani's argument against Cohen: It applies to his own client. Trump lies — constantly, flagrantly, provably. You might think that a smart lawyer, capable of seeing around a looming corner, would think twice before labeling someone else a \"pathological liar.\" Especially since Trump's lies include the very subject on which Giuliani now claims that Cohen's alleged account should be discounted and Trump's credited. If Cohen tells you the sky is blue, check the color. In a swearing contest between Cohen and Trump about the Trump Tower meeting, Cohen's word alone isn't reliable. Still, if there are motives to lie on both sides, whose is bigger? I'd wager the one whose presidency may hinge on the outcome. And the one who has the longer track record of prevarication on this topic. Trump is implicated in — he is the architect of — the original lie, about the contents of the Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer. It was adoption, sure! Trump and his lackeys then lied about the lie, denying Trump's involvement in writing the initial misleading statement about it. \"I do want to be clear that the president was not involved in the drafting of the statement,\" Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow said last July. That untruth was quickly overtaken by misleading spin from White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders: \"The president weighed in, as any father would.\" Any father with zero fealty to the truth. Any father with political — and perhaps criminal — exposure of his own. It is no stretch, then, to imagine Trump lying about whether he knew in advance about the meeting he then lied about. In fact, that would be perfectly in character. Sometimes it is hard to understand why Trump bothers to lie, when the truth is so provable and obvious. But often Trump's lies simply reflect the primitive instinct of the cornered toddler with chocolate smeared on his face, insisting that he had not just raided the cookie jar. Deny first, with accompanying, if not convincing, indignance. Deal with the consequences later. As Giuliani said of Cohen, \"If his back is up against the wall, he'll lie like crazy. Because he's lied all his life.\" We saw this on display with Trump's handling of the Cohen-facilitated payments to porn actress Stormy Daniels. Asked in April about whether he was aware of the $130,000 to ensure Daniels' silence, Trump denied any knowledge. \"You'll have to ask Michael Cohen. Michael is my attorney.\" The next month found Giuliani and Trump himself acknowledging that Trump had reimbursed Cohen for the payment he had just denied knowing about. Now comes Trump, on Twitter, doubling down on his denials about the Trump Tower meeting. \"I did NOT know of the meeting with my son, Don jr. Sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam (Taxi cabs maybe?).\" Maybe. A smart prosecutor will seek corroborating witnesses — Cohen reportedly says they exist — and other indicia of truthfulness. In this case, what were the blocked numbers to which Donald Trump Jr. placed calls at key moments before and after the meeting? What motivated Trump to announce plans, the very day on which the meeting was arranged, for a \"major speech,\" never given, about \"all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons\"? What would it mean if Trump knew about and approved of the meeting with a \"Russian government attorney,\" as Natalia Veselnitskaya was described? It would show that Trump, like his son (\"If it's what you say I love it\"), was eager to obtain dirt on an opponent being peddled by a foreign agent. \"Most people would have taken that meeting,\" the president said last year. \"It's very standard.\" The dangled dirt was not forthcoming. That doesn't excuse a presidential candidate for seeking to procure it. Nor does it excuse a president for lying to the country for months about his role in this sordid transaction.

{"global_context": "“I really believe I'd run in, even if I didn't have a weapon,” he said during a White House meeting with governors. President Trump claimed Monday that he would have rushed into the Florida high school during the mass shooting earlier this month there that killed 17 people, and he called it “disgusting” that an officer assigned to the school didn’t enter the building while the attack was underway. “I really believe I'd run in, even if I didn't have a weapon,” Trump said during a White House meeting with governors from across the country, adding that he thinks the governors assembled also would have rushed into Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. “You never know until you’re tested,” he added. The White House meeting focused in part on the school shooting and the wider issue of gun control. Trump has been highly critical of former Broward County sheriff's deputy Scot Peterson, who remained outside the school during the Feb. 14 massacre in Parkland, Fla. Peterson resigned last week. An attorney for Peterson on Monday denied that his client had acted unprofessionally or cowardly during the shooting. Joseph DiRuzzo said Peterson didn't go inside the school because it had sounded as if the shooting was happening outside the building. [ Broward deputy who didn’t go inside school during shooting thought gunfire was outside, acted appropriately, lawyer says ] At the Monday meeting, Trump suggested he would act to regulate “bump stocks” even if Congress does not. The devices can be added to semiautomatic weapons to make them fire like fully automatic guns; they were used by the gunman who killed 58 people last year in Las Vegas. The device was not used in the Parkland, where the gunman wielded a legally purchased AR-15 semiautomatic weapon. Trump said he would “write off” bump stocks, suggesting he would take action to ban the devices. “I don’t care if Congress doesn’t” act, he said. “We’re getting rid of it. You put it into the machine-gun category, which is what it is.” [ The Daily 202: Trump is driving a surge in public support for stricter gun laws since Florida ] Trump told the governors Monday that he had lunch over the weekend with leaders of the National Rifle Association, and he predicted that the powerful gun lobby will “do something” to respond to the escalating concern nationwide about guns. “Don’t worry about the NRA. They’re on our side,” Trump said. In a sign the Senate could move quickly on one modest gun measure, Republican leaders privately polled GOP senators Monday about the Fix NICS Act, an NRA-backed bill that would create additional incentives and penalties to ensure agencies report pertinent data on potential guy buyers to the National Instant Criminal Background Check system. If all 100 senators agree to pass the bill, or at least limit debate on it, the legislation could quickly pass the chamber. But any one senator can hold up the bill, forcing it through time-consuming procedural hurdles. It is also unclear whether the House would pass the bill as a stand-alone measure. Lawmakers in that chamber passed the Fix NICS Act in December, but attached it to a bill that would require states to recognize concealed-carry permits from other states — a measure favored by the NRA but strongly opposed by gun control advocates. At least one House GOP leader said the Fix NICS bill would be unlikely to get a stand-alone vote. “I would not want to bring a bill up that only addresses one issue with gun safety, because frankly concealed carry reciprocity will increase gun safety,” House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) said in a Friday interview, suggesting the chambers would instead form a conference committee to come up with a compromise bill. Also at the meeting with governors, Trump said he wanted to make it easier for law enforcement to take guns away from mentally ill people, saying police should have “immediate access” to their weapons. “When we see somebody's sick like this guy, when the police went to see him, they didn't do a good job,” he said. “But they have restrictions on what they can do. We've got to give them immediate access to taking those guns away, so that they don't just leave, and he's sitting there with seven different weapons. Got to give them immediate access.” Last year, Trump signed into law a repeal of Obama-era regulations that made purchasing a gun more difficult for people who receive Social Security payments for mental illnesses. Trump also called for a revitalization of mental institutions. “We’re going to have to start talking about mental institutions,” he said. “In the old days,” the president added, it was easier to commit people to mental institutions if they acted “like a boiler ready to explode.” Trump urged governors to revisit the closure of mental institutions, saying there should be a half-measure between institutionalization and leaving potentially dangerous people “in their house.” Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval (R) and Montana Gov. Steve Bullock (D), the chair and vice chair of the National Governors Association, met with reporters after the meeting at the White House and said they were more confident than in the past that this mass shooting would lead to action on school safety, guns and mental health issues. “The status quo is not acceptable. We’ve got to do some things,” Sandoval said. He added, “The president said this is number one on his agenda now, absolutely number one. I think it’s going to be the same for governors.” Bullock said the president’s proposal to arm teachers drew opposition from a number of governors. “I have three kids,” he said. “I don’t want my teachers armed and I don’t think most Americans do.” During the White House meeting, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D), who chairs the Democratic Governors Association, bluntly told the president to shelve the idea. Saying that educators should educate, he added, “I just suggest we need a little less tweeting and a little more listening and let’s just take that off the table and move forward.” Dan Balz and Mike DeBonis contributed to this story.

{"global_context": "Donald Trump had remembered that Saturday evening in April, particularly the 2 minutes and 34 seconds Seth Meyers spent skewering him with joke after excoriating joke. It was 2015 - four years after the White House correspondents' dinner in which Trump had become Meyers's verbal punching bag - and the comic ran into the billionaire at Rockefeller Center during the \"Saturday Night Live\" 40th anniversary special. Meyers told Politico he seized the moment to make an impromptu pitch: Trump should come on \"Late Night.\" They could bill the appearance as a conciliatory meeting four years after the not-so-good-natured ribbing in front of President Barack Obama and a ballroom full of snickering journalists. Trump seemed amenable at the time, but later, Meyers told Politico, he made an intransigent demand: Apologize. Not a behind-the-scenes handshake, or a contrite text message, Meyers told Politico, but a public, on-air apology for making fun of Trump at the White House correspondents' dinner. Meyers refused, Trump declined and the appearance never happened. The incident instead became the subject of coffee-table conversation and, perhaps, an insight into the mind of an aggrieved Trump. The 2011 White House correspondents' dinner may be best known as the day Obama got a bit of revenge at Trump, one of the loudest voices in the birther movement that claimed that the U.S. president was not, in fact, a U.S. citizen. Obama quipped that, if elected, Trump would turn the White House into the \"Trump White House Resort and Casino.\" He said Trump, who flirted with the idea of running in the 2012 Republican primary, showed presidential leadership skills when he fired Gary Busey on \"The Apprentice.\" And, Obama said, now that he had released his birth certificate, Trump \"could finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter, like did we fake the moon landing; what really happened in Roswell.\" But before Obama lit into Trump, Meyers had worked him over, uttering the word \"Trump\" some 16 times, according to a transcript of the many jokes: \"Donald Trump has been saying he will run for president as a Republican, which is surprising since I just assumed he was running as a joke.\" \"Gary Busey said recently that Donald Trump would make a great president. Of course he said the same thing about an old rusty bird cage that he found.\" \"Donald Trump owns the Miss USA Pageant, which is great for Republicans since it will streamline their search for a vice president.\" \"Donald Trump said recently he has a great relationship with the blacks, but unless the Blacks are a family of white people I bet he is mistaken.\" Cutaways showed a stone-faced, unsmiling Trump enduring the fusillade. Years later, pundits wondered: Did that embarrassing night put Trump on a beeline trajectory to be the leader of the free world? Trump had spoken about running for president as early as 1988, but many said the night of Meyers' speech was a watershed moment. The New Yorker's Adam Gopnik wrote in September 2015 that he had been seated a few tables away from Trump in 2011. \"On that night, Trump's own sense of public humiliation became so overwhelming that he decided, perhaps at first unconsciously, that he would, somehow, get his own back - perhaps even pursue the presidency after all, no matter how nihilistically or absurdly, and redeem himself,\" Gopnik wrote. Of course that pursuit would make him an even bigger target for whoever happened to be headlining the White House correspondents' dinner. This year it was Michelle Wolf, who followed in Meyers' footsteps with a caustic diatribe directed at Trump. On Thursday, less than two weeks after that, she'll appear on Meyers' show.

{"global_context": "The clock is ticking on the Republican majority in Congress: The GOP has just over 10 months to avoid a rout in 2018. Republicans could do it. They have time and several important factors on their side: a good economy, low crime rates, achievements of significance to the party’s followers. Nevertheless, as 2017 closes, almost all signs point toward big Democratic gains next year, largely driven by President Trump’s widespread unpopularity. And some of the pugnacious instincts that helped the president win election a year ago may now be worsening his party’s dilemma. Midterm elections “are a referendum on the party in power,” notes Sean Trende, political analyst for the Real Clear Politics website. During the Obama years, Trende correctly forecast that Democrats had underestimated the potential of a surge of conservative white Americans voting Republican. Now, he says, Republicans are making a mistake in assuming that turnout will once again favor them in an off-year election. Trump has “terrible numbers,” Democrats have a large advantage in polls, and “it all adds up to a really rough midterm” for the GOP, Trende says. The trouble for Republicans comes despite some of the best economic conditions in years, which normally would boost the party in power. Unfortunately for Republican candidates, a majority of Americans continues to believe the country is headed in the wrong direction, despite the good economic news. Much of that discontent appears to center on one person — the president. Throughout the year, opposition to Trump has generated energy among Democrats. But something new has been added to the mix in recent months, said Joe Trippi, the veteran Democratic consultant who served as media strategist for Doug Jones’ upset Senate election this month in Alabama. “The sense of chaos, the constant fight, fight, fight and alarm bells going off all the time” has deeply troubled voters, including many who backed Trump last year, Trippi said. “There’s this sense of being on edge,” which Alabamians talked about frequently, Trippi said. “That’s what they don’t want anymore.” Alabama’s election had unique aspects, notably the flaws of the Republican candidate, Roy Moore. But that same voter anxiety has come up repeatedly in focus groups around the country. If a year of Trump has put voters in the mood for less confrontation, that poses a big challenge for Republicans. “I don’t know how you stop Donald Trump from putting people on edge,” Trippi said. “That’s what he does.” Indeed, even if conflict weren’t so deeply ingrained in Trump’s personality, political calculation might lead him to continue seeking out battles at every turn. Voters as a whole may not like it, but to Trump’s most fervent supporters, his willingness to fight forms a major part of his draw. His former strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, threatens to add to the political tension by backing challengers to several Republican incumbents. Trump’s hard-core supporters remain loyal and probably always will. But for all the attention they get from the White House — and often from the news media — Trump’s fervent backers make up only about one-fifth of the public and are outnumbered about 2 to 1 by fervent opponents. Indeed, the gap between the share of Americans who say they “strongly disapprove” of Trump and those who “strongly approve” has grown significantly this year. In polls by SurveyMonkey, for example, the margin now stands at 26 percentage points, up from 16 points at the start of the year. Those numbers form just one of several indicators of problems for Republicans. The most basic comes from the so-called generic ballot — a question polls have used for decades that asks which party’s candidate a person plans to vote for in the next election. It has long proven among the most reliable forecasting tools in American politics. For most of the fall, Democrats showed a healthy lead on that question — enough to suggest the midterms would be competitive. This month, the forecast took an abrupt jump in one nonpartisan survey after another — to 13 points in a poll from Marist College, 15 in Quinnipiac University’s poll, 15 from a Monmouth University survey and 18 points, a previously unheard-of level, in a poll for CNN. Exactly why the numbers for the GOP worsened is unknown, although the timing suggests the unpopularity of the Republican tax bill played a role. What is knowable is that even discounting the biggest numbers, the Democrats’ lead on the generic ballot surpasses that of any party out of power in decades. The average size of the Democratic advantage forecasts that if the election were held now, they would gain in the neighborhood of 40 seats in the House — considerably more than the 24 they would need for a majority. For those who don’t trust polls, actual election results point the same way. Some of the contests have gotten wide attention, including the Alabama Senate race and the Virginia election in November, in which Democrats won the governorship and all but wiped out a huge Republican majority in the lower house of the Legislature. Other, less heralded contests have shown the same pattern of high Democratic turnout, depressed Republican voting and double-digit shifts in partisan outcomes, particularly in suburban areas where Trump fares worse than a typical Republican. On average, Democrats have done about 12 points better than expected in races across the country this year, according to an analysis of more than 70 special elections by the fivethirtyeight.com website. Looking just at federal election contests, the swing has been larger, a 16-point shift toward Democrats. That’s a margin similar to 2006, the last time a pro-Democratic wave swept the party to control of the House as well as the Senate. The current size of the Democratic advantage would overwhelm two of the protections Republicans have counted on — gerrymandering in the House and, in the Senate, a favorable lineup of state contests. In the House, partisan gerrymandering has helped pad Republican majorities in the last three national elections. But a gerrymander works by taking a party’s voters and spreading them out over as many districts as possible — ensuring just enough to win — while packing the other party’s voters into as small a number of districts as clever line-drawing will allow.

{"global_context": "The U.S. House of Representatives voted on Tuesday to condemn President Donald Trump for \"racist comments\" against four minority Democratic congresswomen, a symbolic measure aimed at shaming Trump and his fellow Republicans who stood by him. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives voted on Tuesday to condemn President Donald Trump for “racist comments” against four minority Democratic congresswomen, a symbolic measure aimed at shaming Trump and his fellow Republicans who stood by him. The 240-187 vote, which split mainly along party lines, was the culmination of three days of outrage sparked by a Trump tweetstorm that diverted attention from other business in Washington but had little impact on the president’s overall approval rating, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll. Trump is seeking re-election next year. Trump had told the group of congresswomen on Sunday to “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.” All four lawmakers - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan - are U.S. citizens. Three were born in the United States. Democrats, who have a majority in the House, passed the resolution on Tuesday evening, which said the House “strongly condemns President Donald Trump’s racist comments that have legitimized and increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color.” Four Republicans and one independent joined the Democrats to support the measure. The White House did not immediately comment. Trump’s attacks on the four progressive congresswomen - known as “the squad” - have been viewed as an effort to divide Democrats, who won control of the House in 2018 and have the power to thwart his legislative agenda. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has struggled at times to work with the progressive newcomers in her caucus, staunchly defended them in the debate. After the vote, Omar held a long, animated conversation with Pelosi on the House floor and put her arm around the speaker, the top elected U.S. Democrat. “These comments from the White House are disgraceful and disgusting and these comments are racist,” Pelosi said. “Every single member of this institution, Democratic and Republican, should join us in condemning the president’s racist tweets.” Pelosi’s comments put the House into a two-hour limbo after Republicans argued she went too far in her comments and broke debate rules. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy criticized Democrats for remarks that upset the “order and decency” of the chamber, saying: “Today is the day that historians will write about.” Some Republicans defended Trump’s tweets, like Tom McClintock of California, who said the president was commenting on the patriotism of the congresswomen, not their race. “I wish the president were more temperate in the words he sometimes uses and I agree that the tone of his recent remarks was unnecessarily provocative. But his central point is irrefutable,” McClintock said. U.S. Reps Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) hold a news conference after Democrats in the U.S. Congress moved to formally condemn President Donald Trump's attacks on the four minority congresswomen on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., July 15, 2019. REUTERS/Erin Scott Republican Representative Doug Collins of Georgia said lawmakers should be pursuing reconciliation rather than escalating attacks against Trump, condemning the “breathtaking partisanship of today’s exercise.” Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters that he thought “everybody ought to tone down their rhetoric.” “The president is not a racist and I think the tone of all of this is not good for the country, but it’s coming from all different ideological points of view,” McConnell said. REUTERS/IPSOS POLL: LITTLE POLITICAL DAMAGE Trump has a history of what critics consider race-baiting. He led a movement that falsely claimed Barack Obama - America’s first black president - was not born in the United States, and said after a deadly, white supremacist-led rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 that there were “very fine people on both sides” of the incident. Trump’s approval rating plunged after the 2017 comments. But a Reuters/Ipsos poll this week showed little immediate political damage from his latest tweetstorm. Support among Republicans increased slightly, the poll showed, while he lost support with Democrats and independents after the comments. His overall approval rating was unchanged. At his rallies, Trump has often talked about proposals from the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, which he calls extreme, as he seeks to energize his political base ahead of the November 2020 presidential election.

{"global_context": "By JILL COLVIN and ZEKE MILLER The Associated Press WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has pardoned two ranchers whose case sparked the armed occupation of a national wildlife refuge in Oregon. Dwight and Steven Hammond were convicted in 2012 of intentionally and maliciously setting fires on public lands. The arson crime carried a minimum prison sentence of five years, but a sympathetic federal judge, on his last day before retirement, decided the penalty was too stiff and gave the father and son much lighter prison terms. Prosecutors won an appeal and the Hammonds were resentenced in October 2015 to serve the mandatory minimum. The decision sparked a protest from Ammon Bundy and dozens of others, who occupied the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge near the Hammond ranch in southeastern Oregon from Jan. 2 to Feb. 11, 2016, complaining the Hammonds were victims of federal overreach. The armed occupiers changed the refuge’s name to the Harney County Resource Center, reflecting their belief that the federal government has only a very limited right to own property within a state’s borders. Bundy was arrested during a Jan. 26 traffic stop, effectively ending the protest. Another key occupier, Robert “LaVoy” Finicum, was fatally shot that day by Oregon State Police. In a statement Tuesday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders called that decision to resentence the Hammonds “unjust.” “The Hammonds are devoted family men, respected contributors to their local community, and have widespread support from their neighbors, local law enforcement, and farmers and ranchers across the West,” she said. “Justice is overdue for Dwight and Steven Hammond, both of whom are entirely deserving of these Grants of Executive Clemency.” The pardons are the latest in a growing list of clemency actions by Trump, who has been using his pardon power with increasingly frequency in recent months. Trump has been especially pleased with news coverage of his actions, which included commuting the sentence of Alice Johnson, a woman serving a life sentence for drug offenses whose case had been championed by reality television star Kim Kardashian West. He has repeatedly referenced emotional video of Johnson being freed from prison and running into her family members’ arms, and has said he’s considering thousands more cases — both famous and not. But critics say the president could be ignoring valid claims for clemency as he works outside the typical pardon process, focusing on cases brought to his attention by friends, famous people and conservative media pundits. Aides say that Trump has been especially drawn to cases in which he believes the prosecution may have been politically motivated — a situation that may remind him of his own position at the center of the ongoing special counsel investigation into Russian election meddling. Many have also seen the president as sending a signal with his pardons to former aides and associates caught up in the probe, or lashing out at enemies like former FBI Director James Comey, who oversaw the prosecution of lifestyle guru Martha Stewart, whom Trump has said he is thinking of pardoning.

April 19, 2019, 9:14 AM GMT / Updated April 19, 2019, 9:31 AM GMT By Linda Givetash LONDON — A journalist was fatally shot while reporting on a riot in the Northern Irish city of Londonderry on Thursday, authorities said. Lyra McKee, 29, was described by one colleague as a \"rising star.\" Lyra McKee. Facebook Dozens of Molotov cocktails were thrown at officers during unrest in the Creggan area of the city, according to the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Around 100 people, including youths and members of the media, were at the scene when shots were fired before midnight local time. An eyewitness told the BBC that a gunman fired indiscriminately into a crowd. Leona O'Neill, a local journalist who was present, wrote on Twitter that she was with McKee when she was hit. She said McKee fell beside a police vehicle Land Rover and officers rushed her to hospital, where she died. Tributes praising McKee described her as a warm, wonderful person who was passionate about her profession. McKee had written for publications around the world including The Atlantic and she also edited for California-based news site Mediagazer. Her first book \"The Lost Boys\" was to be released next year, according to literary agency Janklow & Nesbit UK. She rose to prominence in 2014 with a blog post describing the struggle of growing up gay in Belfast, the capital of Northern Ireland. Mark Hamilton, the police force's assistant chief constable, said a murder investigation had been launched. \"We believe this to be a terrorist act. We believe it has been carried out by violent dissident republicans,\" he added. \"Our assessment at this time is that the New IRA are most likely to be the ones behind this.\" The New IRA is a small group of republicans who reject the 1998 Good Friday agreement that marked the Irish Republican Army's embrace of a political solution to the long-running violence known as \"The Troubles\" that claimed more than 3,700 lives. The riot was the latest violent incident in Londonderry this year. The detonation of a large car bomb outside a courthouse in January highlighted the threat still posed by militant groups opposed to a 1998 peace deal that largely ended three decades of violence in the British-run province. No one was injured in the blast. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi led a congressional delegation to the city earlier Thursday, as part of a trip to show support for the peace agreement politicians in Washington helped to broker. British Prime Minister Theresa May called McKee's killing \"shocking and truly senseless.\".

Democratic presidential contender Pete Buttigieg stuck up for NFL player protests during the national anthem, telling TMZ this week that his service in the military was partially about protected the right to protest peacefully. “The flag that was on my shoulder when I served represented, among other things, the right to free speech,” Buttigieg told the TMZ cameraman. “You don’t have to like it but one of the reasons we served was to defend that right, the right to peaceful protest and the idea that we can protest what is wrong with our country,” he said. He echoed his stance during an interview with The Washington Post’s Robert Costa. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, told Costa that in his view, the protesting players were “exercising a right that I had put my life on the line to defend.” “I didn’t think of the flag as something that itself as an image was sacred. I thought of it as something that was sacred because of what it represented,” he said. “One of the very things it represented is the freedom of speech, and that’s one of the reasons I served.” I was trained to stand & salute.

{"global_context": "When it comes to racial episodes, the most jarring difference between President Trump and President Obama is the divergence in the way the two men have chosen to handle them. In other cases, he has ignored or rejected the racial tensions at the core of some high-profile, combustible public issues. Mr. Trump has emerged as the leading critic of the practice by some N.F.L. players of kneeling during the national anthem as a way to protest racial discrimination in policing. Mr. Trump personally, and successfully, lobbied some team owners, who earlier this month created a new anti-kneeling rule. He said his objection to the protests had “nothing to do with race,” but was rather about “respect for our country and respect for our flag.” This week, he took to Twitter to respond to the tweet by the television star Roseanne Barr in which she compared a former Obama aide, Valerie Jarrett, to an ape. But Mr. Trump did not condemn the offensive tweet, or speak about race. Instead, he used the opportunity to complain that critics who had spoken ill of him had not apologized. The president continued on that theme on Friday morning, wondering on Twitter why Samantha Bee had not been fired from her show for using vulgar language to describe one of his daughters. Mr. Trump manages to deftly turn racial issues into left-right political fights that are race neutral, said Ernest Lyles, a black private equity partner who lives in New York. In the case of Ms. Barr’s comments, for instance, Mr. Lyles said the president turned what was simply an issue of someone making a racist comment into a battle between a liberal television network doing wrong to a Republican like him. And Mr. Lyles, 39, said he found that unfortunate because he believed that Mr. Trump could actually do more to heal the country’s racial divide than Mr. Obama, because the people who listen to Mr. Trump are less savvy on racial issues. “Unfortunately, for better or worse, America is trained to be more open, and more conditioned to be led by, a white male than someone who isn’t,” Mr. Lyles said. Despite the concerns that Mr. Trump has helped fuel the country’s sometimes toxic racial climate, recent events demonstrate that there are still consequences for racial discrimination, and racist acts.

{"global_context": "Christine Hallquist made history in Vermont Tuesday night as the first openly transgender nominee for a governorship from a major party in the nation's history, beating back her Democratic challengers in the state's primary. Christine Hallquist made history in Vermont Tuesday night as the first openly transgender nominee for a governorship from a major party in the nation's history, beating back her Democratic challengers in the state's primary. Hallquist defeated educator Brenda Siegel, who earlier was considered a frontrunner in the race, and environmentalist James Ehlers. On the Republican side, first-term Gov. Phil Scott overcame businessman Keith Stern to win the GOP gubernatorial primary, surviving the major political fallout from his decision to sign the state's first major gun control laws earlier this year. Hallquist, a former CEO of the Vermont Electric Cooperative, made no bones about the fact she wanted a place in the history books during the campaign. She's appealed to Vermonters with a progressive message including a livable wage, Medicare for all, free public college education and high-speed broadband access — even to those who live on remote back roads. \"That's how I want to be known in Vermont,\" Hallquist, 62, told The Associated Press in an interview at her Burlington offices. \"Nationally, I want to be known as the first trans candidate.\" Hallquist also defeated another candidate who was trying to make history: a 14-year-old boy, Ethan Sonneborn, who took advantage of the state constitution's lack of an age requirement to seek the governorship. But Hallquist faces long odds in November. No sitting governor has been defeated in Vermont since 1962, and Scott's victory would continue Republicans' surprisingly strong hold on governorships in highly progressive New England. The GOP currently holds the governorships of four out of six states in the region, including Vermont, Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. However, Scott may have a unique vulnerability. In April, he was heckled by a bevy of protesters calling him a \"liar\" and \"traitor\" as he signed sweeping gun regulations into law, citing the dangers posed by mass shootings. The package of bills raised the age to buy firearms from 18 to 21, banned high-capacity magazines, and made it easier to take guns from people considered a danger to themselves or others and from people arrested or cited for domestic assault. Scott's approval rating in the state tanked after he signed the measure, plummeting from 65 percent early in the year to 47 percent shortly after the bill took effect. His disapproval rating nearly doubled to 42 percent in that period. WATCH: PRO-GUN PROTESTERS HECKLE 'TRAITOR' VERMONT GOVERNOR Some results are still pending in Tuesday's other major gubernatorial primaries, including in Wisconsin, Connecticut and Minnesota. Businessman Ned Lamont won the Democratic nomination for Connecticut governor, defeating Bridgeport mayor and ex-convict Joe Ganim. Connecticut is ground-zero for Republican efforts Tuesday to continue their gains in deeply progressive New England. Even though Connecticut voted for Hillary Clinton by double-digits in 2016, the state's governor, Dan Malloy, is deeply unpopular, with critics citing high taxes and an ongoing budget crisis. Malloy declined to seek a third term. Danbury Mayor Mark Boughton, former First Selectman Tim Herbst, businessman Steve Obsitnik, former investment banker Bob Stefanowski and former hedge fund manager David Stemerman are the Republicans looking to succeed him. They have disagreed on key issues, such as whether to eliminate the state's income tax. Meanwhile, in Minnesota, Tim Pawlenty -- who briefly ran for president in 2012 -- is hoping to stage a political comeback and become Minnesota’s governor again, in a race to replace outgoing Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton that Fox News considers a tossup. And in Wisconsin, Democrats are making yet another effort to unseat Republican Scott Walker, a well-known union buster who is seeking a third term. A bevy of Democrats with some high-profile endorsements are competing for the right to take him on in November. The states are also holding key House and Senate races, as Democrats pick their candidate to try to flip retiring Rep. Paul Ryan's seat, and Republicans hope to make gains in the House in Minnesota.

Clockwise from top left, the Democratic candidates for Montgomery County executive: Roger Berliner, Marc Elrich, George L. Leventhal, Rose Krasnow, C. William Frick and David Blair. (Bill O’Leary, Sarah L. Voisin, Katherine Frey and Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post) In largely blue Montgomery County, June might as well be November. So for the six Democratic candidates for county executive, it’s a countdown to the June 26 primary to determine who will succeed longtime executive Isiah Leggett (D) as the leader of Maryland’s most populous jurisdiction. Voters must choose from three sitting council members, a state delegate, a former mayor and a businessman. And while at-large council member Marc Elrich has racked up the most endorsements and was the top vote-getter among at-large candidates in the past two primaries, experts say it is still anybody’s race. “Very fluid,” said Keith Haller, a political analyst who has conducted polling on the contest but has not formally released the results. “You still have over half of the prime Democrats self-identifying as undecided, and it’s an insider’s game with political junkies right now.” What will be key to victory, political observers say, is voter turnout, candidate name recognition and several crucial, yet-to-be-announced endorsements — including the “Apple Ballot,” issued by the county teachers union. That group has said it will wait to see how Elrich and the other council members in the race vote on the budget before deciding whom to back. From left, David Blair, C. William Frick, Marc Elrich and Rose Krasnow after the Democratic candidates for Montgomery County executive debated in November in Chevy Chase. (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post) This year’s crowded field — the numbers of candidates buoyed not just by term limits but also by the new public campaign financing system — makes standing out that much harder. “You have to get voters to recognize your name to begin with and then what it is that is your identity,” said Steve Silverman, a consultant and former council member who ran against Leggett for county executive in 2006. “What is it that you stand for?” Being a sitting council member adds a bump — voters countywide may be more familiar with the names Roger Berliner (D-District 1), Marc Elrich and George L. Leventhal (D-At Large) than those of the other candidates, former Rockville mayor Rose Krasnow, businessman David Blair, and Del. C. William Frick (D-Montgomery). But it could also hurt. County voters in 2016 overwhelmingly approved term limits — a measure pushed by Republican Robin Ficker, a lawyer who will face the Democratic primary winner in November — and some argue the vote was targeted at throwing out familiar faces in county government. The six Democrats have tried to differentiate themselves: Berliner points to his work on the environment and transportation. Leventhal touts his support in the immigrant community and on health and human services. Elrich says he is the progressive, demanding more concessions from developers. Krasnow is running in part because she wants women’s voices to be heard. Blair says he is “the outsider, but with an insider’s perspective.” Frick calls himself a “reformer to Rockville,” the county seat. Elrich, Leventhal and Krasnow opted for the public financing system, which leverages small donations with county funds, while the other three candidates are raising money in the traditional way. None of the candidates have gone negative in campaigning. Debates and forums have been largely cordial affairs that often obscure disagreements among the candidates, such as whether or how to attract development. From left, Roger Berliner, David Blair, Marc Elrich, Republican Robin Ficker, C. William Frick, Rose Krasnow and George L. Leventhal at a February candidates forum in Silver Spring. (Bill O’Leary/The Washington Post) “Even though there’s more than a dime’s worth of difference between the six candidates, you wouldn’t know it in the debates they’ve been holding,” said Gus Bauman, a lawyer and longtime political observer who ran for county executive in 1994. “This is one time when it would be helpful to the county voter for candidates to be candid, not just about themselves but about other candidates.” Jeffrey Slavin, mayor of Somerset and a state Democratic leader, said Elrich “probably is the perceived front-runner right now,” thanks to his endorsements from unions, progressive groups and others, and his past record of getting votes. But Silverman said Elrich is not necessarily leading — he has just done the best job at defining himself. “There’s no survey, public or private, that has anointed anybody a clear front-runner,” Silverman said. “It would be fairer to characterize the executive’s race as Marc has a definitive lane — the far-left, pro-union, anti-development lane. The other five are trying to find their lanes.” Haller said no other candidate “has really surfaced as a solid, clear alternative to Marc Elrich.” “Candidates are afraid if you attack Elrich, you are attacking the groups that he has behind him,” Haller said. “You’re attacking a little bit of the bread and butter of the hardcore Democratic base.” The candidates for county executive are not just competing with each other to emerge at the forefront of voters’ minds. They are also, in a way, competing with 33 Democratic candidates for at-large County Council seats, as well as a trove of candidates in other local and state primary races, including for governor. That means key Democratic voters — those who are most likely to vote in primary elections and thus will be targeted by candidates — will be wading through sheaves of campaign mailings and ads in the run-up to the June primary. And predictions on voter turnout have been mixed. “This is going to be a very small turnout,” Bauman said. “It’s an off-year election. There is no burning issue. It’s at a strange time, the end of June. For all of those reasons, it’s not going to be a huge turnout.” Haller also said the trend is for turnout to be low, with an expected anti-Trump wave among Democrats not likely to manifest until November. But others, including Slavin, said they expect more voters than in recent years. In the 2014 primary, just over 17 percent voted, according to Montgomery County Board of Elections records. In 2010, that number was almost 20 percent. “I’m anticipating we’re going to [have a] big turnout because of so many races going on and everybody has their own little base that they’re going to activate,” Slavin said, adding, “Candidates that can identify that second and third level of participatory voters and get them to the polls for them, that will be very important.” The picture is likely to look quite different in a month as candidates begin marshaling the power of direct mail and other voter messaging. “We’re in the second inning of a nine-inning game,” Silverman said. “For everybody who spends every day focused on it, it seems like we’re at the top of the ninth. There’s a long way to go.”.

Gabel said she looked forward to working with Democratic Gov.-elect J.B. Pritzker. “It’s exciting. Now we can move some of these big issues forward,” she said. That will include stabilizing the state’s financial situation, she said. Gabel said she also looked forward to working on climate, clean energy and mental health issues. In the 17th House District, Jennifer Gong-Gershowitz of Glenview was headed to victory over Wilmette resident Peter Lee with 69 percent of the vote, after 66 of 78 precincts reported. “I’m feeling great, feeling optimistic, and I’m really proud of the positive race we ran,” Gong-Gershowitz said. The Democratic gubernatorial win “makes me feel incredibly optimistic about the future of Illinois,” she said.

{"global_context": "A judicial evaluation form recently was sent to all judges who are up for retention in the Nov. 6 election. It’s not from a bar association or a concerned citizens group. Rather, it was initiated by the Illinois Civil Justice League, a lobbying organization that funnels millions of dollars to various candidates, including judges. What is particularly disturbing is that this organization, which has close ties to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other groups with politicized agendas, is conducting this intimidating exercise in a nonpartisan election for judges. In a letter that went to many judges’ chambers, it said the results of the survey that would be turned into a rating would then be subject to “an aggressive public relations and media campaign … utilizing a variety of traditional earned and paid media tactics as well as social media platforms.” Among the four questions asked was “Name and describe one change you would make in the Illinois court system.” How do these results have a bearing on the retention of judges who have served in Illinois’ courts? That process should focus on a judge’s record on the bench. Or is it merely a veiled reminder that the ICJL and other groups that brag they can secretly funnel corporate campaign funds without leaving fingerprints of the donor have plenty of dark money to spend on various campaigns? Dark money is a term widely used to describe political donations funneled through political action committees that are able to mask the names of those who are really making the contributions. The public should not tolerate this type of campaign funding behind closed doors. Illinois is among 38 states that have some form of electing judges to their highest courts. Campaign finance laws need to be changed to prevent this type of practice, particularly involving judicial elections for this country’s coveted independent branch of government. The voters of this state must demand that legislators examine the issue of dark money so that the appearance of buying judges will not be tolerated. And judges up for retention must leave those evaluation forms blank without fearing that nonresponsive answers will jeopardize their standing on the bench. Certainly donations in elections are part of the process, but they must be made in the light. Justice cannot be bought. Robert A.

{"global_context": "President Donald Trump announced Friday evening that he will nominate Kelly Knight Craft, the U.S. ambassador to Canada and a major Republican donor, to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Craft is set to succeed Nikki Haley, pending Senate confirmation, and is Trump's second pick to replace Haley, who left the U.N. post at the end of last year. The president's first candidate, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, withdrew from consideration last week. Trump praised Craft's tenure at the embassy in Ottawa as \"outstanding\" as he made the announcement on Twitter. \"I am pleased to announce that Kelly Knight Craft, our current Ambassador to Canada, is being nominated to be United States Ambassador to the United Nations,\" Trump wrote. \"Kelly has done an outstanding job representing our Nation and I have no doubt that, under her leadership, our Country will be represented at the highest level. Congratulations to Kelly and her entire family!\" Trump had announced Nauert as his pick in December, but she was never formally nominated. She cited family concerns in withdrawing from consideration. People familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Nauert had employed a nanny who was in the country legally but was not authorized to work in the United States. Trump considered a number of candidates this week for the prestigious ambassadorship, including Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany. If confirmed, Craft is unlikely to hold the same Cabinet-level rank that Haley had made a condition of taking the job. Without that rank, the next U.N. ambassador is not likely to attend as many White House meetings as Haley did and may be less influential. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo welcomed Craft's selection. \"Ambassador Craft has been an outstanding advocate for America's national security and economic interests in Canada and she is extremely well-qualified to do the same at the United Nations,\" Pompeo said in a statement Friday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who said he recommended Craft, a fellow Kentuckian, was quick to celebrate her selection and called it \"an exceptional choice for this critical post.\" \"Kelly Craft is a strong advocate for American interests and will be a powerful representative of our great nation at the U.N.,\" McConnell said in a statement. \"She has a long record of service to her state and the nation and I'm confident she will continue to serve with distinction as America's voice to the world at the United Nations.\" Craft, 56, was a business executive and philanthropist before serving as ambassador to Canada. Her husband, Joe Craft, is president and chief executive of coal producer Alliance Resource Partners. The couple are major Republican donors, having given about $1.5 million to GOP candidates in 2016, including $270,800 to Trump's campaign committee or his joint fundraising committee with the Republican National Committee. The Crafts also have been repeat, high-paying customers at Trump's hotel in Washington, according to a list of \"VIP Arrivals\" distributed to hotel staff on June 19, 2018. That list, obtained by The Washington Post, was intended to help staff identify the Trump International Hotel's most important customers as they checked in. The Crafts were listed as gold-level members of the Trump Card rewards program when they checked in for a three-day stay. They were also described as \"high-rate\" customers, and their listing bore the notation R(20), which former Trump Hotels employees have said indicates customers who've stayed at least 20 times. That was an unusually high number among the hundreds of Trump hotel guests whose VIP listings have been reviewed by The Post. Kelly Craft was sworn in as ambassador to Canada in September 2017. The job representing the United States in Ottawa is a diplomatic plum, but not as sought-after as a posting in important European capitals. The White House search for a replacement for Haley focused on female candidates, and those who had already been confirmed by the Senate for a current or past posting, people familiar with the selection process said. Craft also possesses a current security clearance, another plus, those people said. Craft, who is hardly a household name, would lower the public profile of the U.N. job after Haley, whose prominence as a former South Carolina governor and national GOP star helped project Trump foreign policy priorities but whose independence sometimes rankled other aides. Craft made headlines shortly after assuming her post in Canada when she told Canadian Broadcasting Corp. News that she believes \"both sides\" of the climate change debate. \"I believe there are sciences on both sides that are accurate,\" Craft told the Canadian broadcaster. \"Both sides have their own results from their studies, and I appreciate and respect both sides of the science.\" Climate change is a major issue at the U.N., which sponsored the 2015 Paris climate accords that President Trump has disavowed. In the CBC interview, Craft said the United States can work to counter climate change despite pulling out of the international compact. \"We all have the same goal, and that is to better our environment and to maintain the environment,\" she said.

{"global_context": "The Republican Party has established that it will embrace accused sex abusers, as long as they can win. NEW YORK― On Monday, the Republican National Committee cut a $50,000 check to accused child molester Roy Moore to help him win a seat in the U.S. Senate. The move should have been shocking. Just weeks ago, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he believed the women ― nine, now ― who credibly accuse Moore of pursuing a relationship with them as minors, and in some cases, sexually abusing them when they were as young as 14. McConnell and many other Republicans in Congress called for Moore to drop out of the race, and the RNC yanked its support. But somehow, Moore is still running neck and neck with Democrat Doug Jones. The RNC, smelling a crucial Senate victory, jumped back into the race this week. President Donald Trump offered his full-throated endorsement of the accused sex abuser. And the only Republican in Congress who protested the party’s re-embrace of Moore was Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), an outspoken Trump critic who has already announced his retirement. But Trump refused to drop out of the race, the scandal passed, and the GOP re-embraced him, calculating that a Republican president accused of sexually assaulting women was still better than a Democrat. And the fact that the party is repeating this pattern with Moore ― treating sexual assault like a relatively insignificant political scandal ― suggests that the GOP will tolerate and even embrace serial abusers going forward. “It’s not only a dangerous move, it’s a horrible move,” said Susan Del Percio, a GOP strategist. “Republicans in 2016 said, ‘We know all the problems with Donald Trump,’ and they stayed with him as the party’s nominee.” “But fast-forwarding a year to today, given the amount of light since shed on sexual assault and the awareness, it’s even more dangerous now,” she said. “Frankly, the Republicans and Donald Trump should be very concerned about now what the Republican Party can be branded as going into 2018 as a result of this decision to back Roy Moore.” The GOP’s strategy has always been to let voters decide whether a potential serial abuser is still a viable candidate. When it became clear in late 2016 that Trump could still win the presidential election, Republicans who had distanced themselves from him quickly fell back in line behind him. When he won, RNC Chair Reince Priebus joined his administration. And on Tuesday, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), a very senior member of the Republican Party, acknowledged that a winning amount of votes can basically expunge sexual misconduct from a politician’s record. Hatch on Roy Moore: “if he wins the election we should recognize him as a sitting senator.” Asked if there should still be an Ethics investigation. “Frankly if he gets elected, that will settle an awful lot of the questions.” — Alice Ollstein (@AliceOllstein) December 5, 2017 The strategy is working, for now. Moore is surging in the polls. But if Moore wins, it will set a troubling precedent for future Republican candidates. It means that men who have assaulted women and girls, despite this unprecedented moment of reckoning, still have a chance to run the country, because the GOP will still write them a check. And it means the party treats sexual assault and even child abuse with all the gravity of a gaffe on the campaign trail. Trump’s endorsement of Moore and Moore’s likely win will have consequences well beyond the Senate. An invitation for every man accused of this stuff to deny and go on the attack against his accusers. Of course, Trump never considered this. But that’s the message he sent. — Sam Stein (@samstein) December 4, 2017.

{"global_context": "Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed special counsel Robert Mueller, will leave the Justice Department after a tumultuous two years. CLOSE Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has submitted a letter of resignation to President Donald Trump. Time, Time WASHINGTON – Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, whose tumultuous tenure at the Justice Department was defined by his management of the sprawling investigation into Russian election interference, announced his departure Monday after two years in which he was often the target of President Donald Trump's scorn. Rosenstein, whose exit has been expected for months, submitted a resignation letter to the president in which he offered both gratitude to Trump and veiled references to the extraordinary challenges posed by the investigation that shadowed the first two years of Trump's administration. \"I am grateful to you for the opportunity to serve; for the courtesy and humor you often display in our personal conversations; and for the goals you set in your inaugural address: patriotism, unity, safety, education and prosperty,\" Rosenstein wrote Monday. His resignation is set to take effect May 11. Rosenstein's praise for the president comes less than two weeks after Russia special counsel Robert Mueller delivered a scathing account of Trump's conduct in which he repeatedly sought to limit or derail the investigation. While Mueller did not resolve whether Trump's actions were criminal, Rosenstein and Attorney General William Barr determined that there was insufficient evidence to charge the president with obstruction of justice. The investigation found that the Russian government launched a \"sweeping and systematic\" effort to intercede in the 2016 election and help Trump win the White House and that his campaign welcomed the assistance, but it did not find sufficient evidence to show that Trump or his aides conspired in the effort. The investigation – and its conclusions – have been a fraught and partisan issue since Trump's first days in office. \"We enforce the law without fear or favor because credible evidence is not partisan and truth is not determined by opinion polls,\" Rosenstein said in his letter. \"We ignore fleeting distractions and focus our attention on the things that matter, because a repoublic that endures is not governed by the news cycle.\" He also appeared to defend the inquiry that Trump has castigated as a \"coup,\" and for which Trump subjected him to public insults. \"Our nation is safer, our elections are more secure, and our citizens are better informed about covert foreign influence efforts,\" he wrote. Then he quoted Thomas Paine: \"Those who expect to reap the blessings of freedom must undergo the fatigues of supporting it.\" A career federal prosecutor, Rosenstein was thrust into an unusually public role for the agency's second-in-command almost immediately after taking office when then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself in the midst of the Russia inquiry. Sessions' disqualification ceded authority for the extraordinary investigation into whether the president's campaign conspired with the Kremlin to his 54-year-old deputy. Among his first actions as deputy attorney general, Rosenstein authored a memorandum that Trump used as the basis for firing then-FBI Director James Comey. Trump's abrupt action later became part of Mueller's examination of whether the president sought to obstruct the Russia probe. Comey's firing so shook public confidence in the Russia inquiry that just days later Rosenstein appointed Mueller, a former FBI director, to lead the investigation as a Justice Department special counsel. Throughout his tenure, Rosenstein often found himself in the middle of a politically-charged battle in which Trump and congressional allies cast the deputy attorney general as a ringleader in partisan \"witch-hunt\" while Democrats came to view the Republican as an unlikely guard against White House interference. Rosenstein noted in a New York speech April 25 that the Obama administration chose not to publicize the full story of Russian computer hackers and social-media trolls attempting to undermine the country. The FBI disclosed classified information about the inquiry to lawmakers, which was then leaked to reporters. The FBI director alleged that Trump pressured him to close the investigation, but the president denied the conversation occurred. \"So that happened,\" Rosenstein said. \"But the bottom line is, there was overwhelming evidence that Russian operatives hacked American computers and defrauded American citizens, and that is only the tip of the iceberg of a comprehensive Russian strategy to influence elections, promote social discord, and undermine America, just like they do in many other countries.\" Mueller's investigation concluded March 22 when Mueller submitted his confidential report to William Barr. The inquiry did not establish that Trump or his campaign had coordinated with Russian efforts to influence the election. Although the special counsel did not resolve the issue of whether Trump obstructed justice, Barr and Rosenstein concluded that the president's conduct was not criminal. Rosenstein rarely responded to the the president's criticisms even when their differences made him a likely target for dismissal. Indeed, Rosenstein had considered resigning from his post last year in the wake of a New York Times report indicating that the deputy attorney general suggested invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump. Rosenstein strongly denied the report, which indicated that he suggested recording Trump's conversations in hopes of triggering the president's removal from office. The incident prompted a hastily-called White House meeting where Rosenstein expected to be fired – only to return to the Justice Department later that day with his status unchanged. While at the White House, Rosenstein spoke by telephone with Trump who at the time was attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York. The two reached an apparent understanding that Trump later acknowledged. “My preference would be to keep him, and to let him finish up,” Trump said about Rosenstein, adding once again that the investigation “is a witch hunt.” While the deputy attorney general's relationship with Trump was often uncertain, Rosenstein was a steady defender of Mueller and repeatedly assured lawmakers that the special counsel was proceeding appropriately. After meeting with top members of the Senate Judiciary Committee in June 2018 – Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. – Rosenstein thanked them for their commitment \"to follow the facts wherever they lead without any improper outside interference.\" He said agents and prosecutors would base decisions on neutral standards and credible evidence, while completing the inquiry \"as promptly as is feasible.\" \"I'm very confident that when the history of this era is written, it will reflect that the department was operated with integrity,” Rosenstein told USA TODAY during a rare interview in March 2018. Trump nominated Jeffrey Rosen, the current deputy secretary at the Transportation Department, on March 26 to succeed Rosenstein. Career prosecutor Rosenstein had been a career attorney at the Justice Department before taking the No. 2 post. He graduated with highest honors from the University of Pennsylvania with a degree in economics and then earned a law degree from Harvard, where he was an editor of the law review. He clerked for D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Douglas Ginsburg. Rosenstein joined the department in 1990 through the attorney general’s honors program, and he prosecuted corruption case with the criminal division before taking a succession of roles in the department's headquarters. In the 1990s, he joined independent counsel Kenneth Starr’s investigation of President Bill Clinton. Rosenstein helped convict three onetime associates of the Clintons – Susan McDougal, James McDougal and former Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker – on fraud and conspiracy charges in May 1996. Former President George W. Bush appointed Rosenstein the U.S. attorney in Maryland in 2005 and former President Barack Obama kept in place to 2017. Trump made him deputy attorney general, setting Rosenstein up for his biggest clash yet. In his letter, Rosenstein said the Justice Department \"bears a special responsibility to avoid partisanship.\" \"Political considerations may influence policy choices, but neutral principles must drive decisions about individual cases,\" Rosenstein wrote, He quoted former attorneys general Robert Jackson, Edward Levi and John Ashcroft, all of whom have called for a Justice Department governed by impartiality and fairness. \"We enforce the law without fear or favor because credible evidence is not partisan, and truth is not determined by opinion polls,\" he wrote. \"We ignore fleeting distractions and focus our attention on the things that matter, because a republic that endures is not governed by the news cycle.\" Barr, who was attorney general under former President George H.W. Bush and returned to the post under the Trump administration, praised Rosenstein for his nearly 30 years with the Justice Department. “Over the course of his distinguished government career, he has navigated many challenging situations with strength, grace, and good humor. Rod has been an invaluable partner to me during my return to the Department, and I have relied heavily on his leadership and judgment over the past several months. I have appreciated the opportunity to work closely with him, and I wish him well in his future endeavors,\" Barr said in a statement. A presidential target Rosenstein's relationship with the president was fraught almost from the start. Thirteen days after Rosenstein was sworn in, Trump fired Comey, a decision that provoked a partisan uproar and that the White House initially said was based on a recommendation from the new deputy attorney general. (Trump later said it wasn't.) Comey's firing ultimately prompted Mueller's appointment. “I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt,” Trump tweeted in June 2017. I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 16, 2017 Trump, who ousted Sessions the day after the November 2018 midterm election, repeatedly criticized Sessions, Comey, Rosenstein and Mueller for their roles in the probe.

By February 2018, Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee released a report that documented that Rosenstein signed an application for a surveillance warrant targeting former Trump campaign aide Carter Page, as had Comey and two other deputy attorneys general. The criticism from House Republicans occasionally became heated. At a House Judiciary Committee hearing June 28, Republicans accused Rosenstein of hiding documents and argued that the 13-month investigation had already taken too long. \"We caught you hiding information!\" said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. Rosenstein wagged a finger at the congressman seated to his left, calling his remarks \"deeply wrong.\" \"It's not accurate, sir,\" Rosenstein said. \"I am not hiding anything from you.” Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., expressed his frustration with the Mueller investigation. \"Whatever you got, finish it the hell up!\" Gowdy implored, adding that the inquiry was \"tearing the country apart.\" \"I want him (Mueller) to finish the investigation as expeditiously as possible,\" Rosenstein responded. Rosenstein acknowledged in his April 25 speech that not everybody was happy with the investigation. But he said it helps to keep a sense of humor in Washington because politicians evaluate issues in terms of immediate impact and mercenary critics are paid to express passionate opinions. \"They make threats, spread fake stories, and even attack your relatives,\" Rosenstein said of professional provocateurs. \"My job is to enforce the law in a non-partisan way; that is the whole point of the oath of office.\" Read or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/29/deputy-attorney-general-rod-rosenstein-resigns-after-russia-probe-ends/1605373002/.

{"global_context": "CNN anchor Anderson Cooper slammed President Donald Trump on Friday night for not holding North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un accountable for the death of 22-year-old American college student Otto Warmbier. CNN anchor Anderson Cooper slammed President Donald Trump on Friday night for not holding North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un accountable for the death of 22-year-old American college student Otto Warmbier. During Thursday’s press conference at the summit in Hanoi, President Trump was asked about whether he had confronted Kim about Warmbier, who was imprisoned for seventeen months in North Korea and died a week after his release. Trump took Kim at his word that the dictator had no knowledge of Warmbier’s detainment. Cooper began by ripping Trump for referring to Kim as a “real leader” during an interview with Fox News’s Sean Hannity. WARMBIER'S PARENTS PUSH BACK ON TRUMP COMMENTS, BLAME KIM'S 'EVIL REGIME' FOR SON'S DEATH “Kim Jong Un, a man who has imprisoned anyone who he even suspects of not liking him. We’re talking about a man who has imprisoned thousands if not over one-hundred thousand people in gulags, multiple generations of families, children, parents, grandparents, that’s a ‘real leader’ in the president’s opinion?” Cooper asked. “Kim Jong Un once ordered the killing of a family rival with an anti-aircraft gun, that’s a ‘real leader?’ This is the guy who poisoned his own half brother at a busy foreign airport with a weapon of mass destruction, that’s a ‘real leader?’ That apparently is President Trump’s idea of real leadership- and it’s not normal. It’s alarming.” Cooper invoked President Ronald Reagan who ordered Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin wall and insisted that President Trump “probably would have complimented” him on how “strong” and “beautiful” the wall was. TRUMP WAS 'ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IN ENDING VIETNAM SUMMIT TALKS, HIGH RANKING NORTH KOREA DEFECTOR SAYS The CNN primetime anchor then went after the president, who he accused of having a “long distance love affair” with Kim Jong Un, for his comments on Warmbier and for the tweets that followed on Friday. “Who has been held responsible for Otto Warmbier’s killing? Who? Mr. Trump takes credit for getting Warmbier out in time to die in front of his family. What about demanding to know what exactly was done to this young American and by whom?” Cooper told his viewers. “As far as the president is concerned, no one in the top leadership of the most repressive regime in the world knows a thing. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP “Nothing says love like telling his family, ‘you’re welcome.’ Nothing shows American resolve like playing defense attorney to a dictator. And nothing inspires respect in a dictator, whether it’s the one in Pyongyang or Riyadh or Moscow in letting them lie to you and saying you believe those lies over the professionals, the American professionals whose only job and whose sole sworn duty is to tell you the truth,” Cooper concluded.

{"global_context": "Trump chill: He has made it clear that agents and prosecutors who investigate him, his administration or his campaign risk their jobs and reputations. CLOSE Trump chill: He has made it clear that agents and prosecutors who investigate him, his administration or his campaign risk their jobs and reputations. When I retired from the Department of Justice, shortly before the start of the 2016 presidential campaign, I found myself obsessively watching and reading the news. In an effort to reduce my chances of a stroke, I channeled my frustration with all things Trump into writing political op-eds. Then I sent them to family, friends and many of the federal prosecutors I’m still in touch with in several U.S. attorney’s offices. And from those prosecutors who get my articles, I’ve received nothing but an unabashed two thumbs-up. Until now. Since taking office,President Donald Trump has been pressuring the Department of Justice to prosecute his political opponents and the law enforcement team responsible for initiating the Russia investigation. Attorney General Jeff Sessions resisted. But when Trump installed William Barr as the head of federal law enforcement, Trump had a strategy in mind. With a presidential twist of the arm, Barr raised a white flag before the first tendon snapped. Trump wants investigators to fear him So began the Justice Department’s all-out offensive to ­“investigate the investigators.” In its wake, I’ve started receiving emails from federal prosecutors that go something like this: “Please keep sending me your articles, but don’t send them to my office email anymore.” At first, I was surprised that my former colleagues would have any concern about receiving an article published in a mainstream newspaper. But over the past two years, the president has publicly buried government employees who investigated criminal activity connected to him or his campaign. FBI Director James Comey, Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, FBI agent Peter Strzok and FBI attorney Lisa Page all worked on the investigation that documented Russian election interference designed to help Trump take the White House. All were fired or forced from their jobs. Attorney General William Barr. (Photo: Andrew Harnik/AP) Add to that list the president’s statement that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein should be jailed for appointing special counsel Robert Mueller and Trump’s order directing White House counsel Don McGahn to fire Mueller. And just last week, in response to word that Mueller is scheduled to testify before Congress this month, the president falsely accused the former special counsel of destroying text messages between Strzok and Page and added, “That’s illegal. That’s a crime.” Unvetted and unconfirmed: Obama didn't want a 'what now' moment if he won. Trump didn't plan and now we have chaos. The president’s public campaign to turn the tables on the investigators is not limited to tyrannical retribution. It is designed to make prosecutors and agents second-guess every move they make in future investigations, for fear of becoming a target of the agency that employs them. It’s designed to make them think: If I seek a wiretap on a Trump associate who is actively involved in criminal activities, will I end up spending the rest of my career prosecuting illegal reentry cases? Or, will DOJ assign someone to look through every text on my work phone, like they did to Strzok and Page? What will they do with the embarrassing personal texts they find? Trump gets results with pressure and fear Former FBI legal counsel Jim Baker said recently that the Trump-Barr attack on law enforcement will have a “chilling effect” on investigators who will worry that by investigating Russia’s interference in our elections, they could end up “being investigated themselves.” I originally ended this piece with the comforting thought that Trump’s efforts will have no effect on those who inherit the duty of investigating corruption in the administration for which they work. But days passed, and I could not get myself to submit it for publication. Civil rights assault: Trump Justice Department has turned 'religious liberty' into a license to discriminate While I continue to have unfailing admiration and respect for the agents and prosecutors who dedicate themselves to the often thankless work of righting wrongs and keeping us safe, they are human. For all of Trump’s shortcomings, his superpower is influencing people through pressure, and desire, and fear. If the moral decomposition ofBarr, Rudy Giuliani and retired Marine Corps Gen. John Kelly has taught us anything, it is that. I don’t know Sarah Fabian. Yet I’m willing to bet that when she joined the Justice Department’s legal team, she never imagined she would be the subject of a viral video in which she defended DOJ’s position that it is entitled to withhold basic sanitary supplies, like a toothbrush and soap, from children in detention camps who are sleeping on concrete floors with foil blankets. Paralysis and fizzled investigations There wasn’t a gun to Fabian’s head at last month’s court hearing. But as she squirmed under the inquisition light of the judges’ pointed questions, I could see DOJ’s long arm and a shadow of the threat that no doubt accompanied her into court that morning. Trump and his eager henchman Barr have made clear that agents and prosecutors who investigate the president, his administration or his campaign are at risk of losing their jobs, their reputations and even their freedom. It isn’t necessary for Trump to expressly prohibit investigations he wants stymied. As the president’s former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, testified to Congress, Trump expresses the subtext of his illicit directives in code. It so happens that agents and prosecutors, who have experience investigating the illegal activity of mob bosses, are well-versed in translating criminal code. For law enforcement agents and prosecutors, second-guessing means lost opportunities and investigations that fizzle when they should spark. For Donald Trump, investigative palsy is not an unfortunate side effect of the most recent iteration of his DOJ takeover. Fear, and the paralysis that follows, is the point. Michael J.

{"global_context": "Vice President Pence voiced America's commitment to remove Nicolas Maduro from power in Venezuela alongside South American presidents Monday. Vice President Mike Pence joined several South American presidents in Colombia Monday, renewing President Donald Trump’s declaration that “all options are on the table” to remove Nicolas Maduro from power in Venezuela. “Nicolas Maduro is a usurper with no legitimate claim to power,” Pence said alongside the presidents of Colombia, Panama, and Bolivia, as well as Interim President of Venezuela Juan Guaidó, and the vice president of Brazil. Pence declared, “Nicolas Maduro must go.” “The struggle in Venezuela is between dictatorship and democracy, between oppression and freedom, between the suffering of millions of Venezuelans and the opportunity of a ‘new future’ of freedom and prosperity,” the U.S. vice president said. “It was utterly unconscionable that Maduro blocked hundreds of tons of aid from reaching impoverished people across Venezuela. But he literally danced while truckloads of aid with food and medicine burned.” “The Lima Group has proudly led hemispheric efforts to call out the Maduro regime for its slide into dictatorship,” Pence said to the Lima Group audience gathered in Bogotá, Colombia. “And today, thanks in large part to the leadership represented here today, more than 50 nations have joined us in recognizing Interim President Juan Guaidó as the only legitimate President of Venezuela.” Pence called on the group, “As we stand here today, for all that we have done before, it’s time to do more.” “Many of your countries have pledged to crack down on the regime’s money-laundering and other corrupt activities, and to cut off the worst offenders from the financial system completely,” he went on. “As the people of Venezuela take to the streets to reclaim their liberty, it’s time to make good on those promises.” The vice president laid out action items for the group: … today, with great respect, the United States calls on all the nations gathered here to intensify efforts to deny the Maduro regime access to financing and take the following actions to isolate the Maduro dictatorship. First, we call on all Lima Group nations to immediately freeze the assets of PDVSA. Second, we urge you to transfer ownership of Venezuelan assets in your country from the Maduro’s henchmen to President Guaidó’s government, and to do so immediately. We also urge all nations present to restrict visas for Maduro’s inner circle, and vote to recognize President Guaidó’s representative at the Inter-American Development Bank. These are important steps that the members of the Lima Group should endorse today and your nation should implement tomorrow. It’s time. Pence then brought word of Trump’s directive to show U.S. support in taking these actions, saying that “effective today, the United States will impose additional sanctions on regime officials, including three border-state governors implicated in last weekend’s violence and a member of Maduro’s inner circle.” He went on, “These men worked to block aid for people in need and suppress peaceful protests while their tyrant danced in Caracas. Their actions will not go unpunished.” Michelle Moons is a White House Correspondent for Breitbart News — follow on Twitter @MichelleDiana and Facebook.

{"global_context": "Once the Republican savior, now he sends out Trumpian conspiracy tweets. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) with President Trump. Joe Raedle/Getty Images Opinion writer One of the most revealing sidelights to the recent Florida recounts was to see Sen. Marco Rubio tossing off conspiracy-mongering tweets about missing ballots and stolen votes, a positively Trumpian display that more than a few people who once admired Rubio found disheartening. Sean Sullivan reports: Just four years ago, Marco Rubio was gearing up to run for president with an inclusive and sunny message designed to capture the imagination of a modernizing Republican Party — and maybe even the country. Those days, and that candidate, are long gone. Like many Republicans, the second-term Florida senator has sounded more and more like President Trump since the 2016 election — striking a notably darker and foreboding tone while adopting some of Trump’s slash-and-burn political tactics and controversial positions. This could be an object lesson in the moral perils of political survival, a story about how easy it is for a politician to lose his soul if he cares too much about one day reaching the brass ring of the presidency. But Marco Rubio’s story is also a microcosm of everything that has happened to the Republican Party over the past decade — its promise and its shameful descent. In fact, you can get an almost-complete understanding of that history just by marking Rubio’s highs and lows, his setbacks and ill-fated reinventions. Rubio won election to the Senate in 2010 as part of the tea party wave and was immediately hailed as a future star. He was intensely conservative but lacked the off-putting hard edge of so many of his ideological compatriots. Many believed he was the person who could sell Reagan-style conservatism to a changing America. Eloquent and charismatic, Rubio was young (only 39 at the time), bilingual and more tuned in to pop culture than your average senator. He liked to quote hip-hop lyrics on the Senate floor. Not long after the presidential election of 2012, which many Republicans felt Mitt Romney lost in no small part because of his harsh anti-immigrant rhetoric, Rubio appeared on the cover of Time magazine under the headline, “The Republican Savior.” The accompanying article said, “GOP leaders know they have a demographic problem. They hope Rubio can help provide the solution, which is why they’ve chosen him to deliver the response to Obama’s State of the Union address on Feb. 12—in English and Spanish.” Rubio worked hard with the bipartisan Gang of 8 to produce an immigration bill everyone could live with, one that included both increased border security and a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Then came the backlash. The immigration bill passed the Senate in June 2013 but died in the House, and Rubio found himself the target of withering contempt from many of the same right-wing media figures who had celebrated him so recently but now portrayed him as an advocate of amnesty for illegal immigrants. So when he decided to run for president in 2015, he thought he could repudiate the bill he helped write, advocate a tougher stance on immigration and use his firm conservatism on every other issue to convince the GOP base that he could still be their champion. But he still misunderstood where the party was. “The time has come for our generation to lead the way toward a new American Century,” he said in the speech announcing his candidacy. “Yesterday is over, and we are never going back.” Then Donald Trump happened, and the problem for Rubio wasn’t just Trump himself but what he revealed about the Republican electorate. It turned out they weren’t looking for someone who could sell conservatism to a changing America. Instead, “going back” was precisely what they wanted. Only one candidate told them he could make America everything it was when they were young, especially that he could get rid of all the immigrants they so despised. The most emblematic moment of Rubio’s fall may have come in an ad, little noticed at the time, that he ran as his fortunes were declining during the primaries. In the ad, Rubio says, “This election is about the essence of America, about all of us who feel out of place in our own country.” This was stunning, because the whole point of Rubio’s entire political career had been that he doesn’t feel out of place in modern America. But even he resorted to channeling the anxieties and resentments of old, white people when it became clear where the nomination battle was being fought. And, of course, he lost. He was supposed to be the Republican version of Barack Obama, but it turned out that wasn’t what Republicans wanted at all. And now, his antennae still tuned to the party’s base, he tries to be just Trumpian enough to maintain their affection in preparation for his inevitable 2024 presidential run. But what will Rubio find when he mounts that campaign? Will the party decide its members really do need to find a way to appeal to nonwhite voters — for real this time? Or will Trump’s white nationalism have become so inextricably woven into what it means to be a Republican that Rubio will find himself in the same position with primary voters that he was in 2016, unable to break through the voters’ attraction toward the candidate offering the most direct appeal to their fears and hatreds? A great deal depends on whether Trump wins reelection in 2020. If he loses, Republican voters may be more open to Rubio’s appeal, the loss of power convincing them that the party has to change if it’s to survive. In the meantime, Rubio will keep trying, however insincerely, to give the GOP base what he thinks it wants. But he can’t change who he is. Rubio was supposed to be the Republican who could sell a changing America on Reagan-style conservatism. But as long as Trump-style conservatism is what the GOP wants to sell, Rubio probably won’t get the chance.

{"global_context": "The president helped propagate the myth that a white genocide is unfolding on South African farms. South Africa’s government isn’t a huge fan of Donald Trump right now ― but to the country’s white supremacists and other extremist groups, the president of the United States is a “ray of hope.” Back in August, Trump parroted a conspiracy theory ― touted by neo-Nazis and Fox News host Tucker Carlson ― that problems with South Africa’s post-apartheid land reform and its murder rates amount to “white genocide.” Trump claimed at the time that the South African government was seizing land from white farmers and killing them on a “large scale.” That’s simply not true, as a new CNN investigation confirms. Though the notion of “white genocide” in South Africa has wormed its way into the conservative American mainstream, there’s no evidence to support the claim that farmers (let alone white farmers) are being killed at disproportionate rates to those of other groups of people, according to CNN’s report. There’s a murder problem in South Africa, but it’s not specific to white farmers, who own more than 70 percent of private farmland despite making up only 8.9 percent of the population. I have asked Secretary of State @SecPompeo to closely study the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers. “South African Government is now seizing land from white farmers.” @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 23, 2018 Trump’s August tweet was an immediate hit among American neo-Nazis and white supremacists. In South Africa, the president’s rhetoric had an even more significant effect. It signaled to that country’s extremists that their pushing of conspiracy theories was working so effectively that a world leader had signed on. Simon Roche, a South African white nationalist seen alongside neo-Nazis at the deadly rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last year, is the public face of his country’s white genocide hysteria. He’s a leader of the Suidlanders, an organized group of white supremacists who believe that a race war is coming. If any one person is the barometer for white supremacist anxiety in South Africa, it’s Roche, and he sees Trump as a champion of his movement. In Trump’s tweet, “we saw a ray of hope,” Roche told CNN. “Maybe there are people out there who know and care and have power and influence. Only time will tell how much is smoke and mirrors, shadows and dust.” As a groan-worthy bonus to that interview, Roche regurgitated Trump’s “very fine people on both sides” rhetoric when talking about far-right extremist groups in the U.S. and the Charlottesville rally. He referred to America’s fascists as “great guys.” “We toured for six months last year,” he said. “The thing that struck us was the classiness of the people who attended our talks. They are not your radical neo-Nazi kind of people. In venue after venue, in presentation after presentation, we met sterling young guys ― great guys ― magnificent manners.” With the wind of Trump’s bloviating in its sails, South African white victimhood is taking a world tour. Members of AfriForum, which bills itself as a minority civil rights group for white South Africans, have made trips to America and Australia to spout propaganda about ethnic cleansing.

{"global_context": "If the N.R.A. was compromised by Russia, the whole party's in trouble. Of all the interlocking mysteries of the Trump-Russia scandal, one that I’ve found particularly perplexing is the utter servility of congressional Republicans before a president many of them hate and believe to be compromised by a foreign power. Yes, I know they’re thrilled about tax cuts and judges. Given how Russia has become a patron of the right globally over the last decade, some Republicans might welcome its intervention into our politics, believing that the Democrats are greater enemies of the Republic. And some are just cowards, afraid of mean tweets or base blowback. But that doesn’t explain why, for example, Speaker Paul Ryan, a Russia hawk who is retiring in January, allowed his party to torpedo the House Intelligence Committee investigation into Russian interference in the election. Ryan, after all, knows full well who and what Donald Trump is. In a secretly recorded June 2016 conversation about Ukraine, obtained by The Washington Post, the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, said, “There’s two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump.” Far from disagreeing, Ryan said, “What’s said in the family stays in the family.” If he were patriotic — or even if he just wanted to set himself up for a comeback should Trump implode — he would have stood up for the rule of law in the Russia inquiry.

{"global_context": "\"Absolutely unacceptable, if not offensive,\" said Sen. Cory Booker. WASHINGTON ― The Senate voted Thursday to advance one of President Donald Trump’s judicial nominees, Michael Brennan, who spent his confirmation hearing dodging questions about whether racial bias exists in the criminal justice system. Every Republican on the Judiciary Committee voted for Brennan, a white Wisconsin lawyer who is Trump’s choice for a lifetime seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit. GOPers on the committee are Sens. Chuck Grassley (Iowa), Orrin Hatch (Utah), Lindsey Graham (S.C.), John Cornyn (Texas), Mike Lee (Utah), Ted Cruz (Texas), Ben Sasse (Neb.), Jeff Flake (Ariz.), Mike Crapo (Idaho), Thom Tillis (N.C.) and John Kennedy (La.). Every Democrat voted against Brennan. When Brennan appeared before the committee last month, he bizarrely avoided questions by Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) about whether there is racial bias in the U.S. justice system. His responses ranged from saying he would “do my very best” not to be biased, to talking about his volunteer work, to saying he might give an opinion if he could have a look at the data that Booker was drawing from to say there is racial bias. Booker was dumbfounded ― particularly because Brennan, who was a state trial court judge in Wisconsin for nine years, should know there are lots of data. “You’re a judge in the United States of America and you have not looked at issues of race in sentencing and the criminal justice system?” Booker asked. “I find this astonishing.” Federally collected data is clear on the racial divide in the justice system. Black drivers, for example, are more likely to be pulled over than white drivers. White drivers involved in traffic stops are searched at lower rates than black drivers. Black people spend more time behind bars than white people for the same crimes, and black people are three times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white people ― even though the two groups use cannabis at roughly the same rates. During Thursday’s vote, Booker said one of the main reasons he opposed advancing Brennan was because of the judge’s “insulting” and “dangerous” responses to his previous question. “To be nominating a federal judge who does not even acknowledge the persistent impact of race within our justice system and doesn’t even have a plan or thoughts on it, to me, is stunning and absolutely unacceptable, if not offensive,” Booker said. Brennan’s nomination now heads to the full Senate for a final vote. Democrats were also upset that Grassley, the committee chairman, gave Brennan a hearing at all, given that he bent the rules to do it. Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) never turned in her so-called “blue slip” to signal her support for a hearing on Brennan, who is from her home state. It’s longstanding tradition that the chairman won’t give a nominee a hearing unless blue slips are turned in. Grassley ignored that tradition and held a hearing anyway. “I think we just took a very perilous step that not only eliminates the blue slip with respect to circuit judges, but also disables the very often bipartisan committee selection process with respect to circuit judges,” said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). Sasse accused Democrats of setting the precedent for blowing up Senate rules in 2013, when then-Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) lowered the threshold from 60 to 51 votes to advance most nominees on the Senate floor in response to the GOP’s ongoing obstruction of President Barack Obama’s nominees. “I think the things you’re lamenting are sad,” Sasse told Whitehouse. “You’re pretending it started today. It’s B.S.” But Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), who formerly chaired the committee, chided Grassley for his unprecedented decision in 2016 not to give a hearing to Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. That, said Leahy, damaged the committee more than anything else.

For years, Modi and other leaders of his Bharatiya Janata Party have referred to Gandhi as the \"shehzada,\" or prince. Critics accuse him of being aloof, a cosmopolitan elite detached from the harsh realities of India's legions of rural poor. After Congress' hold in Parliament collapsed from 206 of 543 seats to a mere 44 seats in 2014 elections, Gandhi's political obituary was all but written. But with small businesses and farmers hurt by some of Modi's signature policies, and mob attacks on Muslims on the rise, Gandhi and the inclusive, secular politics the Congress party has long represented are starting to resonate. Gandhi is seeking re-election for a fourth consecutive time in the Uttar Pradesh town of Amethi. The general election, which is being held in seven phases, ends May 19, and vote counting begins on May 23. \"In finding his feet in politics, Gandhi has become a perfect foil for Modi,\" said political commentator Seema Mustafa. \"He comes through as humble, democratic and responsive, and plays on love, peace and humanity as against hate and aggression. The smile against the wagging finger, the embrace against the threat — it is all now part of a persona, natural and yet crafted.\" If Gandhi came across as a reluctant politician, the reasons are not hard to find. His family, starting with his great-grandfather, Jawahalal Nehru, has produced three prime ministers. Two of them, his grandmother Indira Gandhi and father, Rajiv Gandhi, were assassinated in office. \"In my life, I have seen my grandmother die, I have seen my father die, I have seen my grandmother go to jail, and I have actually been through a tremendous amount of a pain as a child,\" Gandhi said in a 2014 interview with an Indian TV channel. Even after becoming a lawmaker, he distanced himself from political life, refusing to even call himself a candidate for prime minister. In 2014, he was re-elected in Amethi, considered a Gandhi bastion, by only a thin margin. Yet, under relentless public scrutiny, Gandhi has honed his public speaking and leadership skills. He now comes across as more confident, forceful and credible, according to political analysts. And he is also starting to come across as a vigorous and even pugnacious campaigner. In Parliament, where he's represented Amethi since 2004, he had been a backbencher, leaving the party reins largely to his mother, Sonia Gandhi. But he's started to hit back. One recent barb in particular struck home — he taunted Modi for wearing a monogrammed suit worth $14,400, saying that Modi's \"suit-boot\" government was only for the rich. Perhaps most important, Gandhi has shown he has the stomach for a fight, even challenging Modi, a much more experienced politician, to a public debate. Modi has ignored the challenge. Gandhi's biggest political triumph in 15 years was easily Congress' win in assembly elections in December, wrangling power away from Modi's BJP in the states of Rajasthan, Madya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Suddenly, the BJPs' preferred Gandhi jibe — \"pappu,\" Hindi for greenhorn — began to fall flat. Suhsmita Dave, head of the Congress party's women's wing, said she has known Gandhi well for a decade and he's basically the same man. The only difference, she said, is that earlier, he held back out of respect for protocol, letting his mother run the party and Manmohan Singh lead the Congress-controlled government. \"He let them get on with their jobs. This gave the BJP a chance to paint him as a reluctant politician,\" Dave said. \"But the truth is that he was never a leader in a hurry. He waited his turn. When it came, he took the bull by the horns and has been vocal and aggressive. There is no point firing your gun until the time is right.\" Still, critics say there's a long way to go. Gandhi brought his sister, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, into the party, appointing her to oversee a post in the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh that includes Varanasi, the Hindu holy city where Modi is up for re-election as a member of Parliament. Her popularity has drawn huge crowds to campaign events, but it may not be enough to counter her brother's perceived sluggishness. Gandhi has been criticized for his low attendance in the last Parliament, showing up just over half the time; for being abroad at critical moments; for describing power as \"poison\"; for not cultivating a younger generation of Congress leaders; and for failing to fulfill a promise to overhaul his party's hierarchy. He also was unable to forge an alliance with two important opposition parties in vote-rich Uttar Pradesh to wrest power away from the BJP in the current election. In New Delhi, too, he was unable to tie up with the ruling party to combat the BJP. Whatever the result of the election, Gandhi is now seen as a feisty opponent, most recently in an interview with the daily Indian Express newspaper. \"That destruction of the idea of an invincible Mr. Modi, that destruction of the lie of Mr. Modi, is primarily the work of the Congress party,\" he said.

{"global_context": "Gubernatorial candidate John Chiang on Friday defended a website he launched attacking opponent Gavin Newson’s record, saying it was important for voters to learn the facts about the candidates in the race. “I think it’s important that people have a good, strong perspective about everybody’s work and activities, so we thought we wanted to make sure people understood my background, my claims and what other candidates are also offering,” Chiang, who is state treasurer, told reporters. The website, www.gavinfacts.com, features a San Francisco Weekly article critical of Newsom’s tenure as mayor of San Francisco and a link to Chiang’s campaign website page about his accomplishments. Newsom’s campaign dismissed the attack as a “sign of desperation” driven by Chiang’s standing in the polls, fundraising and endorsements. Chiang made the remarks after speaking at the California Economic Summit, a bipartisan gathering of civic and business leaders working to address the state’s affordable housing, trained workforce and water shortages. He called for bringing back redevelopment agencies, which use a portion of property tax money to partner with developers to encourage development in blighted areas. The agencies were authorized by law in California in 1945 and shuttered in 2012. They helped transform areas such as San Diego's Gaslamp Quarter, but in some instances they were criticized for subsidizing private developers with little public benefit. Chiang said when he was state controller he reviewed redevelopment agencies and identified misdeeds and inappropriate uses of money. “We would have greater safeguards in place,” he said. Chiang said he would require 20% of new housing units created through such agencies to be set aside for moderate- and low-income housing, and would also focus on workforce housing that would allow teachers, police officers and others to live in the communities they serve.

{"global_context": "After the two couples — President Donald Trump and his wife and federal judge Brett Kavanaugh and his wife — gathered in the residence of the White House for over an hour Sunday night, Trump made Kavanaugh a historic offer: to be his choice to succeed Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court. Yet just hours later on Monday morning, Trump seemed to waver — making a flurry of calls to friends and allies and asking them what they thought of Kavanaugh and whom he should nominate. Some White House advisers fretted Trump might reverse himself even after informing Vice President Mike Pence and White House Counsel Donald McGahn that he had reached a final decision. Others shrugged off his apparent waffling as the showman president attempting to inject a last bit of suspense into his second Supreme Court nomination. The 24-hour whirlwind leading up to Monday night's prime time announcement, and the 12-day stretch that preceded it, was classic Trump — a freewheeling process involving an eclectic cast of advisers and punctuated by bouts of indecision and drama. \"All a little misdirection,\" said a White House official, speaking anonymously to share a candid look at the search. \"How much did he enjoy the media tripping all over themselves? I'm sure he loved it.\" Ultimately, in Kavanaugh, Trump chose not just an unabashed conservative candidate likely to please his base but one who appealed to him for other reasons, as well: personal chemistry, Ivy League credentials and a compelling personal story. Raj Shah, a White House spokesman, likened the nomination strategy to a marketing campaign, saying it had the benefit of pitching a premium product. \"We have a well-qualified, articulate nominee whose record will sell itself,\" Shah said. This portrait of Trump's Supreme Court nomination decision is the result of interviews with more than two dozen White House aides, members of Congress, Republican operatives, outside advisers, presidential friends and confidants, many of whom requested anonymity to share details of private conversations. Trump \"landed where he started\" said a senior White House official, explaining that the president settled on the federal judge who had been his favored candidate since learning of Kennedy's retirement. Kavanaugh was also the top choice of McGahn, who sat in on nearly every interview and meeting. Kavanaugh's years in the White House of George W. Bush, who then nominated him to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, were a knock against the judge in the eyes of Trump, who frequently rails against the Bush dynasty. But those concerns began to dissipate during their initial in-person interview on July 2, when the 72-year-old president and the 53-year-old judge established a rapport. Kavanaugh advocates also worked to convince Trump that merely by offering him a lifetime appointment to the nation's top court, the justice would inherently become a \"Trump guy\" rather than a \"Bush guy.\" \"Bush put him on the D.C. Circuit; Trump put him on the Supreme Court,\" a senior White House adviser said. \"That's not a lateral move.\" Both McGahn and Kavanaugh also sought to portray the judge's lengthy record — including more than 300 opinions, roughly a dozen of which were affirmed by the Supreme Court — as a benefit rather than a potential stumbling block. While it might complicate his confirmation process, they told Trump, Kavanaugh would be the safest and most appealing candidate for the president's conservative base. After that first sit-down, Kavanaugh emerged as the clear front-runner. One person familiar with the interview said Kavanaugh, who worked closely with Bush as his staff secretary, \"knew exactly how to talk to Trump\" because he understands how presidents operate. \"Brett has been planning for this his whole life,\" the person said. Trump, a proud graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, was also impressed with Kavanaugh's dual undergraduate and law degrees from Yale. The president has long viewed an Ivy League pedigree as a mark of intelligence and is, in the words of a senior White House official, an unabashed \"credentialist.\" In the end, one of Kavanaugh's biggest hurdles was that he was the \"conventional wisdom\" pick, while Trump relishes defying the experts. For his part, Trump mostly hewed to the process laid out by activists, basing his search off a list of roughly two dozen judges and legal figures who were preapproved by conservative groups, said Leonard Leo, an executive at the Federalist Society. \"What people need to remember, is the president came up with the idea of doing the list and wanted to make the Supreme Court a very big issue in the presidential campaign,\" Leo said. \"He took ownership of the list, and it helped propel him to victory and hold the Senate, so it's no surprise he wants to be in the driver's seat on judicial selection and keep up what's worked.\" On the same day as the Kavanaugh interview, Trump also met in person with three of the four other finalists — Amy Coney Barrett, Raymond Kethledge and Amul Thapar. (The only finalist he did not meet with in person was Thomas Hardiman, who was the runner-up for the vacancy filled last year by Justice Neil Gorsuch, though the two men spoke twice by phone).

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - At least three people have died in Ethiopia’s southern city of Hawassa, hospital authorities said on Friday, amid a showdown between state security forces and some local activists who want to declare a new region for their Sidama ethnic group. FILE PHOTO: Pedestrians walk on an empty street during a clash between the Sidama youth and a securities after they declared their own region in Hawassa, Ethiopia July 18, 2019. REUTERS/Tiksa Negeri The threat of large-scale violence in Hawassa city center on Thursday was largely averted after a Sidama opposition party agreed to delay declaring their own region and accept a government offer to hold a referendum in five months. The threat to unilaterally declare a new region was a direct challenge to the authority of the Ethiopian federal government, which oversees nine regions in the nation of 105 million people. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, appointed by the ruling coalition last year, has been widely praised for political reforms in what was once one of the continent’s most repressive nations. But many Ethiopian activists are now using their greater freedoms to demand more rights, sometimes for their own ethnic groups. At least eight other ethnic groups beside the Sidama also want their own regions. The tensions sometimes spark violence. In Hawassa, not all Sidama people accepted the decision to delay the declaration. Some activists were still on the streets on Friday and most shops were still closed. Local police told Fana Broadcasting that relative peace prevailed in Hawassa and nearby areas and they are working to restore peace in areas affected by the violence. “Efforts are underway to put under control the violence which started in Hawassa and later spread to the neighboring Sidama woredas (district),” regional state Police Commissioner Tewodros Woldemichael told Fana. Police arrested individuals who took part in the violence that resulted in loss of life and properties, according to Fana. Hawassa Referral Hospital has received 12 injured civilians in the last two days, three of whom died, said general manager Zinaw Serniso. Some had fractured bones after being hit with batons and others had been shot, he said. One man shot in the head died on Thursday, and two more shot in the leg and abdomen died on their way to the hospital on Friday, he said. “The decision by top Sidama administrators to accept a belated referendum meant the zone didn’t self-declare and so a major confrontation was avoided yesterday,” said William Davison, an analyst from Brussels-based International Crisis Group. “But that decision was not accepted by all of the youthful activists, who complained they were not consulted and were further angered when security forces prevented public meetings being held to discuss the situation.” Organized groups in towns outside Hawassa are ransacking houses, business and also robbing people, said Million Tumato, president of the opposition Sidama Liberation Movement. He confirmed three civilians had been killed in Hawassa and said 15 others had been killed in outlying areas. Reuters could not immediately confirm the deaths or the circumstances surrounding them. “At this moment, we cannot calm our people,” he said.

U.S. First Lady Melania Trump, left, Russian President Vladimir Putin, center, and U.S. President Donald Trump, pose with a soccer ball after a press conference following their meeting at the Presidential Palace in Helsinki, Finland, Monday, July 16, 2018. (Alexei Nikolsky, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP) (Associated Press) HELSINKI — The Latest on President Donald Trump’s summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin (all times local): 4:20 a.m. President Donald Trump is dismissing suggestions that Russia has compromising intelligence about him after a news conference in which Trump declined to criticize President Vladimir Putin for Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Trump tells Fox News’ Sean Hannity that Putin “said as strongly as you can say it, they have no information on Trump.” Trump adds, “And one thing you know: If they had it, it would have been out.” He says “it’s a shame” that he and Putin had to answer questions about the investigation into Russian election interference. During the news conference in Helsinki Monday, Putin ridiculed allegations that Russian intelligence agencies had collected compromising information on Trump during his visit to Moscow years before the election. Putin called the allegations “sheer nonsense.” __ 2 a.m. Russian President Vladimir Putin says his summit with U.S. President Donald Trump is the beginning of Russia’s path back from Western isolation. Putin spoke to Fox News after his summit Monday with Trump. The Russian leader says the recent U.S. indictment against 12 Russian military officials accused of hacking crimes during the 2016 presidential election is part of an internal political game. He is denying state-sanctioned Russian interference in the election. Putin also denies having compromising information on Trump and says he “was of no interest for us” before he announced his run for presidency, When asked why so many of his critics wind up dead, Putin is blaming troubles with crime in Russia and noting the U.S. has struggled, too, citing John F. Kennedy’s assassination and clashes between police and civilians. __ 10:45 p.m. Facing withering bipartisan criticism over his refusal to publicly acknowledge Russian election meddling during his meeting with President Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump says the two superpowers “must get along.” In a Monday tweet sent as he is flying back to the U.S. aboard Air Force One, Trump says, “As I said today and many times before, ‘I have GREAT confidence in MY intelligence people.’” He adds, “However, I also recognize that in order to build a brighter future, we cannot exclusively focus on the past — as the world’s two largest nuclear powers, we must get along!” Trump met with Putin for three hours Monday before participating in a joint press conference in which Trump did not contest the Russian leader’s election meddling denials. U.S. intelligence agencies have unanimously concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 campaign, most likely to help Trump’s campaign. __ 7:25 p.m. Russian President Vladimir Putin has rejected allegations that Moscow has collected compromising materials on U.S. President Donald Trump or his family. Asked during a joint news conference following their summit in Helsinki, the Russian leader dismissed the claims as “sheer nonsense.” Putin said that he hadn’t been aware of Trump’s visit to Moscow a few years before his 2016 election, which has been stained by accusations that Russians hacked and interfered in the campaign to support Trump. Putin, a former KGB agent, scoffed at the notion that the Russian security services try to gather incriminating materials on businessmen, saying: “Do you really believe that we try to shadow every businessman?” ___ 7:15 p.m. Russian President Vladimir Putin says he wanted Donald Trump to win the U.S. presidency, but strongly denied any Russian state meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. Putin argued that Trump’s calls for better ties during the presidential election campaign “naturally” made him a preferred candidate for many Russians. Asked if he personally favored Trump in the race, Putin responded: “Yes, I wanted him to win because he spoke of normalization of Russian-U.S. ties.” At the same time, Putin rejected the allegations of collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia as “complete nonsense.” The issue is a big concern for many U.S. voters. Putin spoke during a joint news conference with Trump in Helsinki. ___ 7:05 p.m. President Donald Trump says he sees no reason why Russia would interfere in the 2016 election. Trump resisted when asked Monday to condemn Russian meddling in the election. Instead, he complained about a Democratic National Committee computer server and emails belonging to Hillary Clinton, the Democrat he defeated to win the presidency. At a joint appearance in Finland with Vladimir Putin, Trump repeated the Russian leader’s denials about involvement in the election. Trump said of Putin: “He just said it’s not Russia. I will say this: I don’t see any reason why it would be.” Trump commented after holding hours of private talks with Putin. ___ 7 p.m. President Vladimir Putin says that Moscow and Washington could jointly conduct criminal investigations into Russian intelligence officials accused of hacking during the 2016 U.S. election campaign. Asked if Russia could extradite 12 Russian military intelligence officers indicted in the U.S. last week on charges of hacking into the Democratic election campaign, Putin challenged the U.S. to take advantage of a 1999 agreement envisaging mutual legal assistance. He said the agreement would allow U.S. officials to request that Russian authorities interrogate the 12 suspects, adding that U.S. officials could request to be present in such interrogations. Putin noted that Russia would expect the U.S. to return the favor and cooperate in the Russian probe against William Browder, a British investor charged of financial crimes in Russia. Browder was a driving force behind a U.S. law targeting Russian officials over human rights abuses. Putin spoke after a summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Helsinki on Monday. ___ 7 p.m. President Donald Trump says Russian President Vladimir Putin made an “incredible offer” to allow Russian and U.S. investigators to work together on allegations of Russian cyber attacks. Trump says Putin suggested the U.S. provide its intelligence to the Russian military so Russia can determine the truth of what happened. Trump says he has “great confidence” in his intelligence agencies who have concluded Russia interfered in the election. But Trump says Putin was “incredibly strong and powerful today” in his contention that Russia had nothing to do with election interference. The two presidents spoke during a joint news conference following talks in Helsinki. ___ 6:55 p.m. President Donald Trump says the Russia investigation has been a “disaster” for the United States and has kept America and Russia “separated.” Speaking during a joint news conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, he reiterates that there was “no collusion” between his campaign and the Russian government. Trump says he ran a “clean campaign” and he beat his Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton “easily.” The president says it’s a “shame” there is a cloud over his administration. He says he ran a “brilliant campaign and that’s why I’m president.” Putin is pushing back against claims that his government interfered in the U.S. election. He says there’s “no evidence when it comes to the actual facts.” Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban still needs to do more to avoid the expulsion of his anti-immigration Fidesz party from the main European conservative group, its leader was quoted on Friday as saying. FILE PHOTO: European conservative party leader Manfred Weber gives a news conference inside the main synagogue in Budapest, Hungary, March 12, 2019. REUTERS/Bernadett Szabo Thirteen conservative parties have demanded Fidesz be expelled from the European People’s Party (EPP) over an anti-immigration and anti-EU campaign that attacked European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, a fellow EPP member, and U.S. philanthropist George Soros. Orban, a strident nationalist, has written letters of apology to EPP politicians but Manfred Weber, the German who leads the grouping in the European Parliament, said the Hungarian prime minister had to do more. “If Viktor Orban doesn’t manage to create trust in coming days among the EPP parties and his critics, then things will be difficult,” Weber told Der Spiegel, according to extracts of an interview published on Friday. Tearing down the posters “is a start, but no more”, he said, referring to Orban’s move to take down posters that suggest Juncker and Soros are conspiring to flood Europe with illegal immigrants from Muslim countries. The EPP, made up of the main center-right parties from across Europe, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats, is the largest grouping in the European Parliament. With the EPP preparing now for EU elections in May, Weber - accused by some of having been too conciliatory toward Orban and Fidesz - hopes to replace Juncker later this year as president of the Commission, the EU executive. The EPP gains from an electorally successful central European party like Fidesz in its ranks, while Orban benefits from having a large group in the European Parliament to shield him from censure there. However, his anti-immigrant and anti-EU rhetoric has infuriated many moderate conservatives around Europe. The EPP will hold a secret ballot next Wednesday to decide whether to expel Fidesz from the grouping. The EU has long criticized Fidesz over policies it says threaten the rule of law by imposing party control over the judiciary, media and other institutions. Fidesz rejects this. Some European politicians also condemn Orban’s attacks on Soros, who is Jewish, as anti-Semitic, which Fidesz also rejects.

{"global_context": "Los Angeles County women and Democrats — and Republicans of especially optimistic nature — should find reasons to cheer as they look over the lists of candidates for the area’s congressional elections this year. Those lists became all but official on Friday, March 9, the deadline for candidates to file papers to run in California’s June 5 primaries for federal and state offices. The most-watched races figure to be those in which Republican Rep. Steve Knight is threatened by four Democratic opponents, in which Democratic Rep. Nanette Diaz Barragán is challenged by Compton Mayor Aja Brown and actress-commentator Stacey Dash, and in which Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters makes an inviting target for four Republicans and two other challengers. Republicans’ sudden enthusiasm for taking on Waters puzzles Jaime Regalado, professor emeritus of political science at Cal State Los Angeles. “Maxine, if anything, has gained more popularity with her base in the past year as [Donald] Trump has been president and she’s been a thorn in his side,” Regalado said. “I have no idea why they [Republican candidates] want to be sacrificial lambs. Maybe they want to make names for themselves.” An increase in the number of female candidates is the most noticeable trend, with 17 women among a total of 50 candidates submitting papers with election officials to run in the 15 U.S. House of Representatives districts that rest entirely or mostly in L.A. County. Women comprise 34 percent of candidates, up from 22 percent in the same districts in 2016. This seems to underscore expectations that 2018 will be a political “Year of the Woman” in response to Trump’s election and the sexual-harassment scandals in politics and other industries. The dominance of Democrats in the county is something else that jumps out, even though it’s nothing new. Democratic office-holders are running for re-election in 14 of the 15 L.A. County districts, and the vast majority face no well-known opponents, including Grace Napolitano, D-El Monte, and Norma Torres, D-Pomona, who are unopposed. The biggest chance for an L.A. County congressional district to change parties lies in the race where Knight, R-Palmdale, is being challenged by Democrats Bryan Caforio, Katie Hill, Jess Phoenix and Michael Masterman-Smith. Knight defeated Caforio, an attorney, by 6.2 percentage points in 2016 to earn a second term in Congress. But the 25th District — which includes parts of the San Fernando, Simi, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys — went for Democrat Hillary Clinton over Republican Trump by 6.7 percentage points, making it one of a half-dozen Southern California districts Democrats think they can flip this year. The fact that Republican registered voters are outnumbered by Democrats by a ratio of 4 1/2 to 1 in L.A. County isn’t discouraging GOP candidates from trying to take back some Democratic-held House seats. Barragán, D-San Pedro, probably expected to win a second term easily in the 44th District, which includes San Pedro, Wilmington, Carson, North Long Beach, Compton, Lynwood, South Gate and Watts. But the entry last week of Brown, a popular Democrat looking to move up, raised the possibility of a competitive race between candidates backed by African-American and Latino factions. The race’s profile had risen in February with the entry of Dash, a Republican known for her acting roles and short stint as a Fox News commentator. All four candidates in District 44 are women, including Republican businesswoman Jazmina Saavedra. Brown wrote on Twitter: “Now more than ever, more women are stepping up from the trenches and running for office across the U.S. Complacency is the enemy of progress.” Now more than ever, more women are stepping up from the trenches and running for office across the US. Complacency is the enemy of progress. — Aja Brown (@AjaLBrown) March 11, 2018 Waters, D-Los Angeles, has been elected and re-elected to Congress 14 times, and faced only one opponent in the 2016 primary in the 43rd District, which touches Los Angeles, Carson, Gardena, Hawthorne, Inglewood, Lawndale, Lomita and Torrance. That opponent, Republican Omar Navarro, an online marketer, is back with an aggressive social-media campaign, and this time he’s joined in challenging Waters by Republicans Frank DeMartini, Edwin Duterte and Candace Camper; Democrat Joe E. Collins III, and the Green Party’s Miguel Zuniga. A brash Trump supporter, Navarro, 29, has joined the president in questioning Waters’ intelligence.

{"global_context": "The Republican Party has established that it will embrace accused sex abusers, as long as they can win. NEW YORK― On Monday, the Republican National Committee cut a $50,000 check to accused child molester Roy Moore to help him win a seat in the U.S. Senate. The move should have been shocking. Just weeks ago, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he believed the women ― nine, now ― who credibly accuse Moore of pursuing a relationship with them as minors, and in some cases, sexually abusing them when they were as young as 14. McConnell and many other Republicans in Congress called for Moore to drop out of the race, and the RNC yanked its support. But somehow, Moore is still running neck and neck with Democrat Doug Jones. The RNC, smelling a crucial Senate victory, jumped back into the race this week. President Donald Trump offered his full-throated endorsement of the accused sex abuser. And the only Republican in Congress who protested the party’s re-embrace of Moore was Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), an outspoken Trump critic who has already announced his retirement. But Trump refused to drop out of the race, the scandal passed, and the GOP re-embraced him, calculating that a Republican president accused of sexually assaulting women was still better than a Democrat. And the fact that the party is repeating this pattern with Moore ― treating sexual assault like a relatively insignificant political scandal ― suggests that the GOP will tolerate and even embrace serial abusers going forward. “It’s not only a dangerous move, it’s a horrible move,” said Susan Del Percio, a GOP strategist. “Republicans in 2016 said, ‘We know all the problems with Donald Trump,’ and they stayed with him as the party’s nominee.” “But fast-forwarding a year to today, given the amount of light since shed on sexual assault and the awareness, it’s even more dangerous now,” she said. “Frankly, the Republicans and Donald Trump should be very concerned about now what the Republican Party can be branded as going into 2018 as a result of this decision to back Roy Moore.” The GOP’s strategy has always been to let voters decide whether a potential serial abuser is still a viable candidate. When it became clear in late 2016 that Trump could still win the presidential election, Republicans who had distanced themselves from him quickly fell back in line behind him. When he won, RNC Chair Reince Priebus joined his administration. And on Tuesday, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), a very senior member of the Republican Party, acknowledged that a winning amount of votes can basically expunge sexual misconduct from a politician’s record. Hatch on Roy Moore: “if he wins the election we should recognize him as a sitting senator.” Asked if there should still be an Ethics investigation. “Frankly if he gets elected, that will settle an awful lot of the questions.” — Alice Ollstein (@AliceOllstein) December 5, 2017 The strategy is working, for now. Moore is surging in the polls. But if Moore wins, it will set a troubling precedent for future Republican candidates. It means that men who have assaulted women and girls, despite this unprecedented moment of reckoning, still have a chance to run the country, because the GOP will still write them a check. And it means the party treats sexual assault and even child abuse with all the gravity of a gaffe on the campaign trail. Trump’s endorsement of Moore and Moore’s likely win will have consequences well beyond the Senate. An invitation for every man accused of this stuff to deny and go on the attack against his accusers. Of course, Trump never considered this. But that’s the message he sent. — Sam Stein (@samstein) December 4, 2017.

{"global_context": "It's understandable, perhaps, that much of the press is playing the latest back-and-forth on Russian sanctions as a personal slap at Nikki Haley. It's understandable, perhaps, that much of the press is playing the latest back-and-forth on Russian sanctions as a personal slap at Nikki Haley. Especially given the fact that she slapped back. But there are larger questions about the way the Trump administration makes foreign policy—and who speaks for the president. The White House is certainly capable of bold diplomatic moves—such as the just-disclosed secret meetings between Mike Pompeo, the CIA director and likely secretary of state, and Kim Jong-Un. It's rather startling that this didn't leak—at least until the Washington Post found out about it Tuesday night—and makes the prospect of a Trump-Kim sitdown far more likely. Yet it's also a reminder that Trump apparently didn't consult his previous secretary of state when announcing his own plan to sit down with Kim. And when Rex Tillerson earlier raised the possibility of diplomatic engagement with North Korea, Trump tweeted that he shouldn't waste his energy on Little Rocket Man. The Haley episode began as a bit of Sunday-show diplomacy. The U.N. ambassador said on \"Face the Nation\" that the administration was ready to act against Moscow in the wake of the U.S. airstrikes against Syria over Bashar Assad’s alleged use of chemical weapons against civilians. \"You will see that Russian sanctions will be coming down,\" Haley said. \"Secretary Mnuchin will be announcing those on Monday, if he hasn't already. And they will go directly to any sort of companies that were dealing with equipment related to Assad and chemical weapons used.\" But that didn't happen. The president was watching and \"grew angry,\" according to The New York Times. And that led to what the paper yesterday called \"a remarkable display of discord that stems not just from competing views of Russia but from larger questions of political ambition, jealousy, resentment and loyalty.\" When Trump's new economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, was asked about this, he said Haley \"got ahead of the curve. She's done a great job. She’s a very effective ambassador. There might have been some momentary confusion about that.\" And that did not sit well with the former South Carolina governor. \"With all due respect, I don't get confused,\" Haley said in a statement to Fox's Dana Perino. The Washington Post called this \"an extraordinary rebuke of the White House.\" (Really? Seemed pointed but restrained to me.) Kudlow, who was obviously trying to smooth things over, told the Times he was \"totally wrong\" to call her confused: \"The policy was changed and she wasn't told about it, so she was in a box.\" He also called Haley to apologize. In other words, Haley was following the talking points and no one told her there had been a change on the sanctions, or at least that the decision wasn't final. That was a communications breakdown in the White House. It wasn’t Kudlow's fault, and it wasn't Haley's fault—in fact, she stood up for herself against the boys' club. \"The episode,\" says Politico, \"marks the latest instance of members of Trump's team appearing out of sync with one another or with the president on foreign affairs.\" Is there a \"deeper strain\" between Trump and Haley, as the Times suggests, because she is the administration's most hawkish voice on Russia and he keeps trying to cultivate good relations with Vladimir Putin? It's hard for outsiders to know. Trump did, after all, expel 60 Russian diplomats after that poisoning in Britain. And Haley has emerged as one of the administration's stars—though anyone working for Trump has to be careful not to shine too brightly. Axios put it this way: \"These conflicts with top aides — one of them unfolding in the open — show that, in the end, the president will govern how he wants.\" On that point, there is complete consensus. Footnote: In a similar vein, the Times reported that Jim Mattis urged Trump to get congressional approval before launching the airstrikes against Syria but that the president overruled his Defense secretary. But the Pentagon’s top spokeswoman tells the Washington Examiner that account is \"blatantly false.\".

{"global_context": "Barr suggested over and over that Mueller's letter wasn't really criticizing him. But then he came out and admitted it. Attorney General William P. Barr appeared before Congress on Wednesday having been accused of misleading about and pre-spinning the Mueller report for President Trump. He also came on the heels of a newly reported letter in which Robert S. Mueller III rebuked Barr’s handling of the matter. So it should come as no surprise that he misled about and spun Mueller’s letter, too. The difference this time was that he accidentally gave away his game. From the start of the hearing, Barr emphasized two talking points about the letter: That Mueller later told him nothing was inaccurate in Barr’s summary of the Mueller report’s principal conclusions That Mueller was concerned about news coverage “I asked him if he was suggesting that the March 24 letter was inaccurate, and he said no, but that the press reporting had been inaccurate,” Barr said at one point. He emphasized at another point that he asked Mueller whether the letter was inaccurate. “He indicated that it was not,” Barr said. “He was not saying that and that what he was concerned about” were news reports. The suggestion is that Mueller wasn’t really upset with Barr at all but was, instead, angry with how the media was handling the matter. But Mueller’s letter paints a very different picture. It places the onus for misperceptions of his report squarely on Barr. \"The summary letter the Department sent to Congress and released to the public late in the afternoon of March 24 did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this office’s work and conclusions,” Mueller wrote. “There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation. This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations.” That draws a direct line between Barr’s disclosures and the news coverage. Barr’s insistence that the letter was not inaccurate is a red herring. Something can be strictly accurate but also be wholly misleading and cherry-picked, and Mueller clearly viewed Barr’s letter as misleading. This wasn’t about how the news media was getting something wrong; it was about how Barr’s letter led it to get things wrong. And it took awhile, but Barr eventually seemed to acknowledge that Mueller had, in fact, rebuked him. Toward the end of the hearing, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) pressed him on his portrayal of Mueller’s letter. Barr then recounted his conversation with Mueller on the phone after Mueller sent the letter. He said he told Mueller: “Bob, what’s with the letter? Why don’t you just pick up the phone and call me if there’s an issue?” Barr then added: “The letter’s a bit snitty, and I think it was written by one of his staff people.” But if the letter wasn’t really criticizing Barr, then why would he be taken aback at it and ask why Mueller wrote it? (Side note: Barr knows why Mueller wrote it: to create a record.) And if this was mostly about news coverage, why call the letter “snitty”? Barr seemed to be admitting, finally, that the letter was what it was: a diplomatically worded but pretty direct rebuke of him and his actions. The parsing of the letter is really a microcosm of the entire Barr imbroglio. The things he was saying were technically true (at least as far as we know), but focusing on them distracted from the real issue. Similarly, it’s not that Barr necessarily lied about anything in the Mueller report but that he cherry-picked what he disclosed to create a narrative unduly favorable to President Trump. Rather than making it clear that Mueller had decided it wasn’t his place to accuse Trump of obstruction of justice, for instance, Barr simply said that he hadn’t done so. That left some with the impression maybe Mueller viewed the evidence as inconclusive. Barr largely danced around his differences with Mueller earlier in the hearing, but by the end, it was clear that this was about as contentious a situation as it seemed.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congressional Democrats moved closer on Monday to citing Attorney General William Barr for contempt of Congress over his failure to hand over an unredacted version of the Mueller report, escalating a showdown with the White House. FILE PHOTO: U.S. Attorney General William Barr speaks at a news conference to discuss Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential race, in Washington, U.S., April 18, 2019. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo The Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee issued a report citing Barr, an appointee of President Donald Trump, for contempt of Congress after the expiration of a second deadline to produce the full report. The panel will consider on Wednesday whether is should move ahead with the bid to hold Barr in contempt and if it does so, the full House will then vote the issue. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. Barr missed an initial deadline last week from the committee, which wants to see the entire report from Special Counsel Robert Mueller on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. “Attorney General Barr failed to comply with the committee’s request for these documents and thereby has hindered the committee’s constitutional, oversight and legislative functions,” the committee’s contempt report said. The Trump administration is stonewalling multiple probes by House committees that were taken over by Democrats in January after Americans voted to end the House Republican majority in the November 2018 election. A contempt citation could lead to a civil court case against Barr, raising the possibility of fines and even imprisonment for failure to comply. The committee report calls on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to take “all appropriate action” to enforce a subpoena issued by committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler. Barr released a redacted version of the report last month but the Democrats also want to see the full report and underlying evidence that informs it. ‘NO CHOICE’ “The attorney general’s failure to comply with our subpoena ... leaves us no choice but to initiate contempt proceedings,” Nadler said in a statement. “If the department presents us with a good faith offer for access to the full report and the underlying evidence, I reserve the right to postpone these proceedings,” he said. Republicans reject Nadler’s efforts as political theater, which they say is intended to satisfy the Democrats’ voters. Senior Judiciary Committee Republican Doug Collins said Democrats were pursuing a contempt citation even as Justice Department officials continue to negotiate with the panel. “Democrats have launched a proxy war smearing the attorney general when their anger actually lies with the president and the special counsel, who found neither conspiracy nor obstruction,” Collins said in a statement. Some Democrats have called on Barr to resign, accusing him of protecting Trump by effectively clearing the president of criminal obstruction of justice and excusing actions viewed by them as evidence of misconduct. Pelosi has charged that the attorney general lied to Congress, adding: “That’s a crime.” Nadler’s committee views the full Mueller report as vital to its own corruption and obstruction of justice investigation of Trump. The chairs of five other House committees investigating the president have also called for its release. The Mueller report details extensive contacts between Trump’s 2016 campaign and Moscow, but did not find that there was a conspiracy between Moscow and the campaign. The report also describes actions Trump took to try to impede Mueller’s investigation. If lawmakers established that Trump obstructed justice by seeking to impede Mueller, Nadler’s panel could move to impeachment proceedings against the president for high crimes and misdemeanors. Trump denied any wrongdoing in a tweet on Monday. “Also, there are ‘No High Crimes & Misdemeanors,’ No Collusion, No Conspiracy, No Obstruction. ALL THE CRIMES ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE, and that’s what the Dems should be looking at, but they won’t. Nevertheless, the tables are turning!” the president wrote on Twitter. Some Democrats on Nadler’s panel say lawmakers could also exercise their own little-used “inherent” authority to act outside the U.S. judicial system to apprehend, fine and even imprison officials who do not comply with congressional subpoenas. Barr also skipped a hearing before Nadler’s committee last Thursday, after Democrats adopted an aggressive format that would have subjected the attorney general to questions from staff attorneys.

Patten, 47, pleaded guilty in August to communicating with U.S. lawmakers and news media organizations on behalf of a Russia-aligned political party in Ukraine called the Opposition Bloc without disclosing that work to the Justice Department, in violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), among other offenses. Patten is a former business partner of Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian national indicted by Mueller and accused of having ties to Russian intelligence. In Patten’s guilty plea he also admitted to arranging for a U.S. citizen to act as a straw purchaser to pay $50,000 for four tickets to the inauguration of President Donald Trump on behalf of a Ukrainian oligarch, who reimbursed Patten through a Cypriot account. Patten’s lawyer had asked for a sentence of probation, saying his case was unlike other FARA prosecutions, which have typically involved a lobbyist attempting to conceal the identity of the client and the source of funds. Prosecutors had not suggested a specific sentence but said leniency was warranted given Patten’s cooperation with the special counsel’s probe.

{"global_context": "Was there no one in America who could have been appointed attorney general who isn’t Robert Mueller’s BFF?. The Senate Judiciary Committee opens its confirmation hearing Tuesday for former Attorney General William Barr to become attorney general again. Is there no one eligible to become the next attorney general who doesn’t have a more than 25-year personal relationship with Special Counsel Robert Mueller? Mueller is investigating whether President Trump or his associates conspired with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign to help Trump get elected. Barr, who is expected to win Senate confirmation to become attorney general in the Trump administration, would become Mueller’s supervisor if confirmed. TRUMP'S AG PICK WILLIAM BARR SAYS IT IS 'VITALLY IMPORTANT' THAT MUELLER'S RUSSIA INVESTIGATION CONTINUE Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., revealed that Barr worked with Mueller when Barr previously served as attorney general from 1991 to 1993 under President George H.W. Bush. But on top of that, the two were “best friends” and their wives attended Bible study together. This came as stunning news to many conservatives, who had hoped that Barr would rein in the out-of-control special counsel. When added to the knowledge that Mueller had attended the weddings of Barr’s children, it is clear that Barr’s relationship with the special counsel is extremely close. I’m shaking my head in almost stunned disbelief. Was there no one in America who could have been appointed who isn’t Mueller’s BFF? There can be no doubt that William Barr is as qualified of a nominee as can be imagined, having already served in the capacity of attorney general in the past and being one of the most respected conservative attorneys in Washington over the past two decades. The nominee even cautioned that Special Counsel Mueller should be very careful before constructing any obstruction charge against the president based on perceived motivations rather than defined acts, because the charge itself could lead to other unintended consequences that would undermine the administration of justice. Hopefully, President Trump has found the honest man who not only can shine a light on the corruption within the Justice Department but also has the guts and the legal gravitas to do something about it, becoming the swamp’s worse nightmare. Barr wrote this as someone who had held not only the role of attorney general, but also deputy attorney general – the same job that is currently held by the Rod Rosenstein, who is reviled by many conservatives. Barr also served as the head of the Office of Legal Counsel, which writes official opinions for the Justice Department. With that background and perspective, Barr could be a brilliant choice to run the Justice Department. With public confidence in the Justice Department and FBI at the bottom of the barrel, Barr’s intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the department would allow him to begin the cleanup that is desperately needed. Another important point in Barr’s favor is that his tenure as attorney general was marked by an emphasis on breaking a cycle of gang violence that was beginning to take hold in the nation. That experience will prepare him for the challenges facing the country due to the encroachment of the MS-13 gang into our cities, violently competing with existing illegal drug distribution networks. In the private sector, Barr worked for GTE, which became Verizon, until his retirement in 2008. He then became a board member of Time Warner Corporation. Barr’s tenure at Time Warner included deep involvement in the legal wrangling between the company and the Justice Department over its still-contested merger with AT&T. The former attorney general has rightfully recused himself from considerations related to the problematic consolidation of media power that the AT&T-Time Warner merger represents. Normally in politics, situations are pretty cut and dried. Nominee A is a conservative or nominated by a Republican president, so conservative and limited government groups line up to support him or her. But as is seemingly increasingly true about virtually everything, the William Barr nomination is not so easy. A friend of Mueller will be responsible for overseeing the Mueller investigation – an investigation marred by partisanship and prosecutorial abuses from the outset, designed to take down President Trump. Mueller knowingly used Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants derived from Democratic research that was called by the then-FBI Director “salacious and unverified” as the pretext for much of its Russia probe. And the Justice Department was so committed to a partisan mission that officials deliberately turned a blind eye to very real concerns about the relationship of both former President Bill Clinton and his Secretary of State wife with both Russia and Hillary Clinton’s apparent violations of laws related to handling classified documents. As attorney general, will Barr excuse his old friend Mueller and former Justice Department colleagues, giving them a pass as just conducting business as usual?

{"global_context": "A suicide bomber struck in Afghanistan's eastern city of Jalalabad on Sunday, killing at least 19 people in the second attack in as many days targeting Taliban fighters, security forces and civilians celebrating a holiday cease-fire. The Taliban later rejected an extension to the cease-fire. Najibullah Kamawal, director of the provincial health department, said another 60 people were wounded in the attack, which struck a crowd of people as they left the governor's compound. Saturday's attack, which also took place in Jalalabad, killed at least 36 people and wounded 65, according to Kamawal, director of the provincial health department. No one has claimed the attacks, but they appear to be the work of the Islamic State group, which is not included in the cease-fire and has clashed with the Taliban in the past. The local IS affiliate has a strong presence in the province. The bomber on Saturday targeted a gathering of Taliban fighters who were celebrating a three-day truce coinciding with the Eid al-Fitr holiday. After the attack, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani announced a nine-day extension of the cease-fire. The chairman of the High Peace Council, a government body charged with negotiating an end to the nearly 17-year war, called on the Taliban to accept the extended cease-fire and join the peace process. \"We hope that the extension of the cease-fire will be announced by the leadership of the Taliban,\" Mohammad Karim Khalili told a press conference in the capital, Kabul. He said there had been an \"exchange of views\" between the government and the Taliban over the past week, without elaborating. But on Sunday the Taliban announced that their cease-fire had ended and they have no intention of extending it. \"The cease-fire was announced by the Taliban for just the three days of the Eid holidays which have come to an end this Sunday evening,\" said Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid in a statement. \"All Mujahidin (Taliban) should continue their operations against foreign invaders and their puppets,\" The Taliban's statement added that their cease-fire for their fighters to celebrate the holiday peacefully and not in response to the government's cease-fire announcement. The Taliban have steadily expanded their presence in recent years, seizing a number of districts across the country and carrying out near-daily attacks on Afghan security forces. But over the past two days Taliban fighters could be seen celebrating the truce alongside Afghan troops and other people in a number of locations. Taliban leaders have at different times expressed interest in holding peace talks to end the conflict. But they have refused to meet with the U.S.-backed government, saying they will only negotiate with the United States directly. They have also demanded the withdrawal of all foreign forces.

{"global_context": "Sean Hannity: Trump has made America great again, despite the Russia hoax. President Donald Trump held a massive rally Thursday in western Michigan where 140,000 people wanted to get into a 15,000-seat arena. And he was touting his impressive record of accomplishments -- you know, the ones the media never talk about. And despite facing a Russia collusion political witch hunt for over two years, the president has guided this country on the right path, with regulations and tax cuts and energy independence for the first time in 70 years -- a booming economy. Record low unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, women in the workplace and youth unemployment. The U.S. is now again the leader and the envy of the world. Why do you think so many people want to come here? The haters were wrong. The media lied for more than two years. The Deep State, thankfully, has now been exposed. Those responsible will be held accountable. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SEAN HANNITY. So while we have been busy reporting the truth, what has happened in the rest of the media? They have been wading through a psychotic rage, a political war against the president. Clearly, they got almost every big story wrong. That is why poor Rachel Maddow, with her tinfoil hat conspiracy hat, lost all credibility. That is why Why CNN and NBC are now experiencing dramatic ratings declines. It's real and deserved. And that's why the tinfoil hat conspiracy theorist, Adam Schiff, the only one left standing, is facing urgent calls to resign from the position atop the House Intel Committee. And rightly so. CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE ENTIRE EPISODE. Remember, it was known leaker and liar Adam Schiff -- we call him \"the cowardly Schiff\" on \"Hannity\" -- who claimed to have clear evidence of Trump-Russia collusion. He's still promising that. However, Robert Mueller's all-powerful, 22-month, $25 million probe found nothing, as did the nine-month investigation of the FBI and the House Intel and Senate Intel committee. Schiff is in Congress, still claiming to have the smoking gun evidence that the investigations did not find. President Trump is calling out the cowardly Schiff. There has to be accountability -- the president is right. Now, we have invited many times the cowardly Schiff on this program to present his damning evidence. He has always declined to come on the program. I also offered three hours of radio, which he has also declined. That's because he has been lying to you, the American people for political gain. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP. California's 28th district, you obviously could do better. Schiff should resign in disgrace. Every single night, every single person, every member of the Deep State will be held accountable. And with the help of key lawmakers and dedicated investigators, equal justice under our law and equal application of the laws will happen. Our constitutional rights will be upheld. But Schiff is not the only bad actor who has been utterly humiliated by this probe. Disgraced CIA-director-turned-NBC/MSNBC tinfoil hat conspiracy theory network hack John Brennan, has called the president on multiple occasions a traitor, pushing conspiracy theories as utter fact almost every day. And it turns out, yes, he was lying on an extreme level. And we are learning something damning about John Brennan. Rand Paul tweeted that a high-level source told him that it was Brennan who insisted that the unverified, fake, Clinton-bought and paid for Steele dossier be included in the intelligence report. The senator says Brennan should be asked to now testify under oath in Congress, as soon as possible. In other words, Brennan used his official position as CIA director to validate the phony Russian, Clinton-bought-and-paid-for dossier. In other words, was he involved in this hoax? Was he trying to set Trump up from the get-go? That would be a blatant abuse of power. How does he have a job at NBC? Andy Lack, phone, you might want to talk to him. Now, this is our promise to you and we take this seriously: Every single night, every single person, every member of the Deep State will be held accountable. And with the help of key lawmakers and dedicated investigators, equal justice under our law and equal application of the laws will happen. Our constitutional rights will be upheld. And come 2020, America's greatness will prevail. Adapted from Sean Hannity's monologue on \"Hannity\" on March 28, 2019.

President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping meet at the U.S. ambassador's residence in The Hague in 2014, ahead of a nuclear security summit. (Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images) Former president Barack Obama has embarked on a three-nation tour with stops in China, India and France, during which he will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his office announced Tuesday. The tour comes just two weeks after President Trump held a summit with Xi in Beijing and days after Trump's daughter, Ivanka, a White House adviser, participated in a global economic summit in Hyderabad, India. Obama opened his trip Tuesday in Shanghai, where he held private meetings and spoke at a trade summit. On Wednesday, he will participate in an education summit in Beijing and meet with Xi. In a news release, Obama's office said the former president had “forged a close and cooperative partnership with President Xi on issues ranging from growing the global economy to combating climate change, and he looks forward to catching up with his former counterpart.” In November 2014, Obama and Xi announced a climate agreement, which was a precursor to the Paris climate accord signed by nearly all the nations in the world. Trump has announced his administration's intent to withdrawn the United States from that agreement at the earliest opportunity in 2020, a move Obama has publicly criticized. In New Delhi on Thursday, Obama is scheduled to speak at the HT Media Leadership Summit and meet with Modi. On Friday, Obama will hold a town-hall-style event for the Obama Foundation with an estimated 280 young leaders from across India, his office said. “The Town Hall will expand the conversation about what it means to be an active citizen and to promote positive change,” Obama's office said. In Paris on Friday and Saturday, Obama will speak at the introductory session of the Les Napoleons Summit and hold private meetings.

Members of Lindsey Davis Stover’s family were attending Santa Fe High School on Friday during the shooting that killed at least eight people. None of her relatives were injured. Stover, a Houston native, is taking a short break from campaigning, according to a statement posted on her Twitter account. “Lindsey’s family members were attending Santa Fe High School today during yet another tragic shooting,” according to the tweet. “She has confirmed they are safe but everyone is rattled. We are briefly suspending campaign activity and will offer a full statement shortly.” Gun control is one the most prominent issues in the six-way Democratic primary; all the candidates favor background checks for every gun purchase and other measures to limit access to firearms. Stover grew up in Houston and earned a bachelor’s degree and one of her two master’s degrees at Baylor University. She was chief of staff to former congressman Chet Edwards, a conservative 10-term Democrat from Texas. After Edwards lost his seat in the Republican wave of 2010, Stover worked as senior adviser for strategic communications to then-Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric K. Shinseki.
